A strong advertisement from France:  
_&#8220;You are young, you&#8217;re healthy, join ToxicCorp and become a &#8216;replacement smoker&#8217;! Every year, 270.000 courageous and motivated youngsters are willing to become addicted to nicotine, and absorb [formol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formol), [cyanide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide) and more than [50 carcinogenic substances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemicals_in_a_cigarette) in order to sustain our profits. Like them, take this opportunity and replace one of our deceased faithful smokers. Your future is in your hands, don&#8217;t hesitate.  
Tobacco kills 1 in 2 smokers. The tobacco industry counts on you to replace them!&#8221;_
