Looks like the Line6 GuitarPort has just gotten an freeware rival:

> Justin Frankel of [Winamp](http://www.winamp.com/) and Gnutella (and Waste, sheesh!) fame has a new projectï¿½and it could be his most wicked yet. The [Jesusonic CrusFX 1000](http://www.jesusonic.com) is a prototype effects processor for musicians, designed to run the [text-based Jesusonic software](http://www.jesusonic.com/soft.php) (available for download on the Jesusonic website). Each button on the prototype triggers a different, linking effect, and new effects algorithms can be coded and compiled in real time for testing.
