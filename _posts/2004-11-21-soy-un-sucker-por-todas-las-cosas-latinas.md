¡Hola! Just spent a week in Salamanca, Spain, _para aprender a hablar español_. I attended a _curso superintensivo_ at [Don Quijote](http://www.donquijote.org/), and did pick up some basic conversation skills after just a week, mostly thanks to the excellent teachers: Virginia, Isabel and Yolanda.

In a previous life I probably have had some hispanic influences, for I am a total sucker for all things spanish. My guess would be: a passionate love affair with a Buenos Aires femme fatale, let&#8217;s call her Elena, who happens to be involved with, say, Angelo, the local maffia godfather. When the latter finds out about our liaison (a kiss, a glance, a restaurant bill?) , he consequently makes me swim with concrete boots, and thus returns my <em>pasión</em>-drenched soul to the reincarnation tredmill with a longing for someone to <em>susurra palabras dulces en mi oído</em>.<br /> (The femme fatale in question would resemble Mia Maestro in <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120274/">Tango, no me dejes nunca</a></em>.)

Another girl with a definite positive influence on men&#8217;s heart rates (well, mine, for one) is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0891895/">Paz Vega</a>. I did a test in Salamanca: if she were to play in a really bad movie, would I still enjoy it? The answer is yes &#8211; no surprise there. The movie was &#8220;Di que Si&#8221; (I won&#8217;t even bother linking to it), and it was really horrendous. Not all spanish directors are Almodovars, Amenábars or Medems, it would seem. But the flick had Paz dashing around in a tiny white tank top (a &#8216;marcelleke&#8217; as they say in Belgium), so I didn&#8217;t care.

I also bought <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0301524/">El otro lado de la cama</a> on DVD, featuring Paz Vega; and &#8220;Lujo Iberico&#8221;, a CD by <a href="http://www.indyrock.es/malarodriguez.htm">Mala Rodriguez</a>, that contains &#8220;<a href="http://rititi.blogspot.com/2004/09/rititi-educa-o-povao-3-hoje-rapaziada.html">Yo marco el minuto</a>&#8220;, from the movie &#8220;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0254455/">Lucia y el sexo</a>&#8221; with &#8230; you guessed it!<br /> Like Penelope Cruz, she has now crossed the Atlantic and is soon appearing in &#8220;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371246/">Spanglish</a>&#8220;, together with Adam Sandler and Téa Leoni.
