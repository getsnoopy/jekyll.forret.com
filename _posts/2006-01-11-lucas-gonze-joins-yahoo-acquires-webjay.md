> A couple years back, [Lucas](http://gonze.com/weblog/) created [Webjay](http://www.webjay.org), a site for easy creation and playback of playlists from the Web. Users can create playlists using music/audio/video from around the Web (with a simple Web form, from [scraping a Web page](http://webjay.org/playthispage), or with a fancy Ajax interface created by a 3rd party using [Webjay API](http://webjay.org/api/help)s), share them with others, [include them on their Web sites](http://www.smoothouse.org/smoothouse/webjay.asp), browse other users playlists, play the playlists in any media player, or cannibalize the playlists to create new ones. With Dave Goldberg (head of [Yahoo! Music](http://launch.yahoo.com/)) running around telling people that the [playlist](http://gonze.com/playlists/playlist-format-survey.html) is the next frontier in digital media, it shouldn&#8217;t come as any surprise that we&#8217;re interested in what Lucas is doing with Webjay. [Y! Music Engine](http://gonze.com/playlists/playlist-format-survey.html) has some interesting playlisting features, [open APIs](http://developer.yahoo.net/music/index.html), and more goodies on the way. Lucas will help shape our strategies around playlisting in the future.

I [discovered Webjay](http://blog.forret.com/blog/2004/10/webjay-playlist-generator.html) around about the same time I got into podcasting, and I got [into contact with Lucas](http://gonze.com/weblog/index.cgi/1-25-5.ongoing) after I did a [survey of web-based Flash players](http://blog.forret.com/blog/2005/01/playing-mp3-with-embedded-flash-player.html) and explored the whole playlist formats issue. I ended up creating a [Webjay button wizard](http://www.smoothouse.org/smoothouse/webjay.asp) because I wanted to link Webjay&#8217;s playlist conversion to Fabricio&#8217;s [Musicplayer](http://musicplayer.sourceforge.net/).

I like this news for a number of reasons:

  * I like Lucas. He takes and welcomes initiative, is smart and has a vision. Yahoo!&#8217;s brainpower just went one notch up.
  * A guy starts an initiative because he has a vision, not because he wants to make money. The site takes off, he builds a recognized brand without patents, seed capital or X rounds of financing, and eventually gets rewarded. A geek story with a Hollywood ending.
