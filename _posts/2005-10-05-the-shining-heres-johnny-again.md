Robert Ryang has become a semi-celebrity movie-remixer overnight:  
![](http://www.pixagogo.com/S5vpfnjbBPdPkUYgO!Koc7IT9MuaZjq4WD68VUGA3LjKnkxtT5coOof4aERnis69bi416iRRCWQ-gjOFOq60d9HDl1MXXLfura8eRnE7b!G69PyUCQ1NIVVQRCTBTkZZo5RIBijzQPjAZEOVmeZthAmw__/shining.jpg) 

> A few weeks back, he said, he entered a contest for editors assistants sponsored by the New York chapter of the Association of Independent Creative Editors. The challenge? Take any movie and cut a new trailer for it but in an entirely different genre. Only the sound and dialogue could be modified, not the visuals, he said.  
> Mr. Ryang chose [The Shining, Stanley Kubricks 1980 horror film starring Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081505/). In his hands, it became a _saccharine comedy(!)_ about a writer struggling to find his muse and a boy lonely for a father. Gilding the lily, he even set it against Solsbury Hill, the way-too-overused Peter Gabriel song heard in comedies billed as life-changing experiences, like last years In Good Company.

Check out the result on [ps260.com (QuickTime &#8211; 10MB)](http://www.ps260.com/molly/SHINING%20FINAL.mov).

If the movie business is anything like the music business, Robert should now worry mostly about getting sued by the [MPAA (Movie Producers Association of America)](http://www.mpaa.org/home.htm), or whoever the copyright holder would happen to be. Unless he gets signed up quickly by one of the majors, in which case his legal costs are covered.

_BTW: picture on the right was altered by me, to make Jack smile (sort of)._
