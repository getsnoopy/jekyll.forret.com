Bernhard Castiglioni has created the ultimate drummer's web site [Drummerworld.com](https://www.drummerworld.com/): bios and pictures of most of the world&#8217;s greatest drummers and lots of [video footage](https://www.drummerworld.com/drummervideo.html). I've spent hours browsing through the recordings and here are some of my favourites:

  * [Brian &#8220;Brain&#8221; Mantia&#8217;s](http://www.drummerworld.com/Videos/Brianmantiagogobeat.html) gogo-beat: you don&#8217;t need dozens of toms and cymbals to lay down a funky groove 
  * Toto&#8217;s [Jeff Porcaro](http://www.drummerworld.com/Videos/jeffporcaro.html) explaining how he created the &#8220;Rosanna&#8221; beat inspired by (he calls it &#8216;stolen from&#8217;) Bernard Purdie, John Bonham and Bo Didley. 
  * [Bernard Purdie](http://www.drummerworld.com/Videos/Bernard_Purdie2.html) who&#8217;s just fabulous but man, does he know it. 
  * [Jeff Hamilton](http://www.drummerworld.com/Clinic/Jeff_Hamilton.html) doing some nice stuff with the brushes 
  * [Gavin Harrison](http://www.drummerworld.com/Clinic/Gavin_Harrison.html) mixes time signatures: _Rhythmic Illusions_ 
  * [Rick Latham](http://www.drummerworld.com/Clinic/Rick_Lathamcowbell.html), with a hairdo that takes us back to the Miami Vice glory days, demonstrates the cow bell 
  * [Jojo Mayer](http://www.drummerworld.com/Clinic/Jojo_Mayer.html) showing how to do a quadruple bass drum beat with 1 foot and 1 bass drum 
  * and the master remains Steve Gadd: see him explain the &#8220;[50 ways to leave your lover](http://www.drummerworld.com/Clinic/Steve_Gadd50ways.html)&#8221; groove or more recent in the [Drummers Collective](http://www.drummerworld.com/Videos/SteveGaddCollective2.html): you don&#8217;t need volume to show off skill

Some names that I miss in his overview: Stevie Wonder, Dennis Davis (who played with David Bowie, Roy Ayers and Stevie Wonder), Phil Gould (from Level 42), Carla Azar (who played with Prince and Wendy & Lisa). Very few [female drummers](http://russlichter.com/mix/2005/03/mix-1-female-drummers.html) on this site, actually, and even less video footage of them.

And then some drummers who just like to show off:

  * [Steve Smith](http://www.drummerworld.com/Videos/stevesmithhihat.html) with the hi-hat 
  * [John Blackwell](http://www.drummerworld.com/Videos/JohnBlackwellstick.html) with his sticks 
  * [Thomas Lang](http://www.drummerworld.com/Videos/ThomasLang2.html) with just about anything 
  * [Buddy Rich](http://www.drummerworld.com/Videos/buddyrichflying.html) with his flying drum kit
