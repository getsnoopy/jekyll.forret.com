![Tango - Marisa y Oliver](http://www.pixagogo.com/Tools/Thumbnails.aspx?thumb=S52T0OqoEbsn2i7JhJU1qXMYd6iPOVmOXTx6xnmXeEsLSSHtGein3aXzquaQ3U-1iHbPm-Ss2TfqSDTbWgvLEpQar7xk9iV1YnY3bKS2yNjQN0DXvtskJcVa!bGfNfMlU9)  
I&#8217;ve taken up [tango](http://tango.smoothouse.com) again and it feels great. My partner is enthusiastic though not exactly docile, but that&#8217;s only to be expected from a spirited girl with a disposition for colourful language.  
Having had little practice in 6 months, it was rather hard to remember even the most basic of steps, certainly those for the girl. I can always find them listed on [tangohk.com&#8217;s &#8220;Learn Tango step by step&#8221;](http://tangohk.com/learn_tango_step_by_step_%20P1.htm), but reading directions like the following doesn&#8217;t always crystalize into smooth movements in your head.

> 1. RF back  
> 2. LF pass RF & to side (long step)  
> 3. RF pass LF & fwd, O/P  
> 4. LF fwd  
> 5. RF close to LF  
> 6. LF fwd  
> 7. RF pass LF & to side, with pivot to left on LF  
> 8. LF close to RF

So I started looking for some video fragments. Because it is expensive to provide movies on-line, the obvious place was to look on sites that sell tango videos. Tango-Argentino.info has some clips from their instruction DVDs, from the basic step to the [Giro derecha con sacadas](http://www.tango-argentino.info/movie/t3_girosacada-1.html).  
I also found some footage at [2leftfeet.com](http://www.2leftfeet.com/tango/video2.html), but they must represent another religion within tango, because I don&#8217;t recognize even the base step.

And to get a feel of what might be possible after enough practice: [clips from The Tango Lesson (1997)](http://www.sonypictures.com/classics/tango/stillsclips.html).
