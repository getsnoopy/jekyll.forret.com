At the Pixagogo reunion dinner the other evening, I was reminded by one of my ex-colleagues Steven (&#8216;[Beukie](http://www.flickr.com/photos/beukie)&#8216;) that back in 2003 I was having some fun with remixes/mashups. More specifically, I took some vocals of the Belgian &#8220;Idool 2003&#8221; preselections, and added music to them. To make the exercise more fun, I took samples from the ones that were really musically challenged.

So I went back in my archives and here are the three that I found:

  * **&#8220;I will you in the night&#8221;  
** Marnik had translated a Flemish song, into his own &#8216;impoverisation&#8217;, as he proudly announces. Unfortunately, the Dutch &#8220;_Ik wil je_&#8221; (I want you) does not normally translate into the English &#8220;_I will you_&#8220;.  
  
    I also found back the original clip on Youtube (via [partybrigade](http://thepartybrigade.blogspot.com/2009/02/i-will-you-in-night.html)):  
    
  * **&#8220;But if I let you go&#8221;  
** This &#8216;Pieter&#8217; was officially called the worst candidate by the jury, and that decision is not impossible to understand. He had no tone, no rhythm and bad English. &#8220;_There snow one like you_!&#8221; He needed a lot of input of Madonna to make it bearable.  
    
  * **&#8220;Killing me softly&#8221;  
** She was not that bad a singer, but her timing wasÂ awful. I remember having to cut and trim a lot to align her words to a steady beat. I made it a slow jazzy version with a lot of echo.  
    

Out of that [edition of Idool](http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idool_2003) came Hadise, Brahim and Natalia, so it wasn&#8217;t all that bad. Still, there was also the girl with the wobbly hands:
