Reading this article on [Applied Minds](http://www.appliedminds.com/) sure brings back memories: 

> Co-founder Danny Hillis escorts me down a hallway that dead-ends into an old-fashioned red phone booth. The phone rings. He places receiver to ear.  
> &#8220;_The blue moon jumps over the purple sky_,&#8221; he says, and hangs up.  
> Suddenly, the booth becomes a door, swinging out to reveal a vast, open room filled with engineers, gadgets and big ideas.

I remember Maarten, Henry, Frederik and me, in the early days of [Keyware](http://www.keyware.com/) (in 1998, I think), preparing a demo for [Walter Debrouwer](http://www.space-time.info/starlab/WdB.html)&#8216;s Riverland company. The latter wanted to impress his prospective client [BP](http://www.bp.com), and so he wanted a biometric access control to his &#8216;labs&#8217;. 

We hacked something together with a hastily purchased badge-reader-annex-intercom, linked to a PC&#8217;s soundcard, running the first beta demo of our speaker authentication software (based on a Lernout & Hauspie technology). I think we even added the Visionics (now [Identix](http://www.identix.com/)) face recognition software we licensed, linked to a [QuickCam](http://www.quickcam.com) webcam. So the system would recognize your face, recognize your voice while you pronounce your passphrase and then let you in when it was sure enough it was actually you. Wonderful when it works. And when it doesn&#8217;t, you can always explain about [false rejection, false acceptance, and equal error rate](http://www.bioid.com/sdk/docs/About_EER.htm). Maarten and me even wrote a white paper on the subject, but I can&#8217;t find that document back, only  [references (PDF)](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/6829/18346/00847020.pdf?arnumber=847020) to it.

[Frederik](http://www.noe.cx/) is now at [Vasco](http://www.vasco.com), Maarten is at [Imec](http://www.imec.be), [Henry](http://www.minassian.com/) has set up [Broncoway](http://www.broncoway.com/). But I have no idea what happened to Veronique, An, Anke, Rudy and the lovely [Julia](http://www.bioscrypt.com/about/executives/bio_webb.shtml). Maybe it&#8217;s time for a reunion.
