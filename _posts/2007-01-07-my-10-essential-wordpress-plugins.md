Since I&#8217;ve been doing quite a lot of WordPress blog upgrading recently, I&#8217;ve been diving into its plugins a lot. There are lots of them around and I have grown a liking to some of them.  
Here&#8217;s a list of plugins that I&#8217;ve found to be essential to any of my WP installations:

  1. **WP Installer**  
    what: install plugins/themes without using FTP  
    why: makes installing and maintaining plugins really easy, even behind a firewall. This is the first plugin I always install.  
    where: [mattread.com](http://mattread.com/projects/wp-plugins/installer-the-plugin/)  
    install: [installer-04.zip](http://mattread.com/download/installer-04) 
  2. **Akismet**  
    what: delete comment and trackback spam &#8211; not perfect but indispensable &#8211; pre-installed on [Dreamhost accounts](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?166410)  
    why: save you time and annoyance by filtering out the real comments  
    site: [akismet.com/](http://akismet.com/)  
    install: [akismet.zip](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/akismet.zip) (v1.2.1) 
  3. **WP Cache**  
    what: keep cached copies of your pages &#8211; pre-installed on [Dreamhost accounts](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?166410)  
    why: speeds up your site  
    site: [mnm.uib.es](http://mnm.uib.es/gallir/wp-cache-2/)  
    install: [wp-cache-2-0-21.zip](http://mnm.uib.es/gallir/wp-content/wp-cache-2-0-21.zip) 
  4. **Brian&#8217;s Latest Comments**  
    what: displays your recent comments in a nicer format  
    why: gives a better view of the popular articles  
    site: [meidell.dk](http://meidell.dk/archives/category/wordpress/latest-comments/)  
    install: [brianslatestcomments.zip](http://brianslatestcomments.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/brianslatestcomments.zip) 
  5. **K2 Theme**  
    what: more than just a theme, includes a WYSIWYG sidebar and customisable header image  
    why: if you can live with its looks, the most powerful theme available  
    site: [getk2.com](http://getk2.com/)  
    install: [k2-091.zip](http://getk2.com/files/k2-091.zip) 
  6. **MightyAdsense**  
    what: manage your Google Adsense code insertion  
    why: easily decide what ad goes where without modifying your theme  
    site: [mightyhitter.com](http://mightyhitter.com/main-page/plugins/mightyadsense/)  
    install: [mightyadsense41.zip](http://mightyhitter.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/mightyadsense41.zip) 
  7. **RunPHP**  
    what: run PHP code inside your blog posts  
    why: create pages that actually do stuff  
    site: [www.nosq.com](http://www.nosq.com/blog/2006/01/runphp-plugin-for-wordpress/)  
    install: [runPHP2.1b.zip](http://www.nosq.com/download/runPHP2.1b.zip) 
  8. **Popularity contest**  
    what: keep track of # views, comments &#8230; of all your posts  
    why: makes it easy to show your popular posts  
    site: [alexking.org](http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress/readme?project=popularity-contest)  
    install: [popularity-contest.zip](http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress/plugins/popularity-contest.zip) v1.2.1 
  9. **Ultimate Tag Warrior**  
    what: add tags/keywords to your posts (Technorati compatible), show related posts based on those  
    why: last tagging plugin you&#8217;ll ever need

    install: [UTW3-141592WP2.zip](http://www.neato.co.nz/plugins/UTW3-141592WP2.zip) 
 10. **Google Sitemap generator**  
    what: creates a Google Sitemap XML file automatically  
    why: because you need it, and you won&#8217;t do it manually anyway  
    site: [arnebrachhold.de](http://www.arnebrachhold.de/2005/06/05/google-sitemaps-generator-v2-final)  
    install: [sitemap.zip](http://www.arnebrachhold.de/redir/sitemap-dl-en/) v2.7
