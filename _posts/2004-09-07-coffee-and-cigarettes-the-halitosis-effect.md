I saw [Coffee & Cigarettes](http://www.coffeeandcigarettesmovie.com/) yesterday, a movie by [Jim Jarmusch](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000464/). For those who haven&#8217;t seen it, it&#8217;s a &#8216;comic series of short vignettes&#8217; with as main theme people drinking coffee while smoking. Jim Jarmusch started the project in 1986 (for Saturday Night Live) with a scene by Roberto Benigni and Steven Wright. I was kinda looking forward to it, but for some reason, it didn&#8217;t do much for me. Yes, Bill Murray is good in &#8220;Delirium&#8221;. Yes, the &#8220;Cousins?&#8221; scene is OK. But Iggy Pop can&#8217;t act, and an equally shitty job is done by Meg White, Roberto Benigni, Steve Buscemi, Joe Rigano, and some other names. Most of the stories weren&#8217;t really compelling. And, but that&#8217;s a personal opinion, I do not consider smoking and drinking coffee at the same time a &#8216;cool&#8217; thing to do or watch. For one, it doesn&#8217;t do wonders for your breath&#8230;  
At which point I&#8217;d like to refer to [Stinken uit de bek](http://www.radio1.be/radio1_master/programmas/dnw/r1_dnw_songbook_20040906/index.html) by the Nieuwe Wereld orkest.
