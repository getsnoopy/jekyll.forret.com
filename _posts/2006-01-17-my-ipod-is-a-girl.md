  * the first time I saw her, I thought she looked absolutely stunning and I wanted to have her 
  * there are others that are thinner, bigger or last longer, but I don&#8217;t want any other 
  * I did not have to read any manual, handling her was very intuitive 
  * every now and then I learn a new trick that I can apply to her and I feel very happy 
  * sometimes when I push her buttons, she does not do what I expect, but I find that a proof of character 
  * she has really improved my quality of life 
  * I have learned a whole lot since we first met 
  * she makes me dance when I walk 
  * other guys can look at her but I don&#8217;t like it when they touch her 
  * some days she&#8217;s very touchy, and it is impossible to let her do what I want. I don&#8217;t get mad, I just leave her alone and a day later she&#8217;s better. 
  * I dread the day that she is no longer around
