One of the more popular pages on this blog is the [post about Richard and Katie](http://blog.forret.com/2006/06/please-make-this-pay): if his site reached 5.000.000 hits, she would allow him to have a threesome (pleasemakethiswork.com). It&#8217;s been three months now, so one wonders: did it work? Well &#8230; kind of.

### Richard and Katie

[<img  src="http://static.flickr.com/76/222085480_1573e6a3db_m.jpg" style="float: right" width="240" height="192" alt="Richard, Katie and Holly" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/222085480/ "Photo Sharing")The old URL now consists of a redirect page to [www.richardandkatie.co.uk](http://www.richardandkatie.co.uk/) (NSFW). On this new site, we learn that the three-way action did take place, it took a full 45 minutes and they&#8217;re still editing it into a 20-minute video that will be available soon. The reinforcement they invited goes by the name of Holly, a dark-haired girl with an above-average cup-size.

> The video will be put up on the site a.s.a.p its taking a few days due to editing &ndash; because believe me there are a couple of things that should be left to the imagination &ndash; for one my inability to perform during the first half hour&hellip; but more on that another day!!!

There is a preview of the video, some screenshots from the video, an empty &#8220;Daily Journal&#8221;, an empty &#8220;Your videos&#8221;, some pictures on the &#8220;Your pictures&#8221; page and a &#8220;Chat board&#8221; (a phpBB forum). They promise to update the site on a daily basis, and I think they mean with that the forum they started on August 11th. Most comments there are either &#8220;_when will the video be ready_&#8220;, &#8220;_is this for real_&#8221; or &#8220;_I think threesomes are bad for your relationship/ emancipation/ ego/ knees/&#8230;_&#8220;. Richard concludes most discussions with &#8220;wait and see!&#8221;.

### Forensics

They sure did a better job of hiding their tracks this time. Their domain name has only a name, but no email &#8211; impossible to trace.

> Domain name: richardandkatie.co.uk  
> Registrant: Barry Mason  
> Registrant type: UK Individual  
> Registrant&#8217;s address: The registrant is a non-trading individual who has opted to have their address omitted from the WHOIS service.

The HTML quality has deteriorated: no `<HTML>` tag, no `</HEAD>` tag, so it might actually be Richard now who&#8217;s making the site (or Holly, who knows what other talents she has). The pro-series stats counter is gone, and the whole site make a more modest impression. 

### Future

The site is sponsored by Golden Root, a provider of blue pills, and they include a quote from Richard: he has used them for his prior film appearance, and will be using them again for his foursome. What foursome? No more info is included on the site. (Apparently it&#8217;s the same bet, but now with 15 Mio hits) An extra 2 girls? An extra 2 guys? Some battery-powered devices? Who knows&#8230;

Why the new domain name? Maybe they sold the first domain name for a good price with a redirect-for-a-period clause. Maybe they realized they had 2 brand names (the pleasemakethiswork domain, and the Richard & Katie personalities) and they would be worth more when split up. But I think their momentum is gone. Somehow I feel they might not get to their 15-millions-of-fame (hits, that is).
