Miel just announced that he will be working [for Microsoft as a enthusiast envangelist](http://blog.coolz0r.com/2006/12/05/changing-jobs/). &#8216;Technology evangelist&#8217; I&#8217;d heard about but how does one evangelize enthusiasm? I did a simple [Google search](http://search.forret.com/google/enthusiast+evangelist) on the term and up came [Benjamin Gauthey](http://www.benjamingauthey.com/), his French counterpart.

OK, they&#8217;re both talented guys, I have no doubt about that, but it&#8217;s obvious that Microsoft also took some esthetic criteria into account. I think Steve Ballmer thought: let&#8217;s steal back some of that female marketshare from Apple. So expect in the future:

  * the Coolz0r Macho Mouse (with authentic stubble and force feedback)
  * Office 2007 &#8220;Female Student edition&#8221; (with the special &#8220;Miel at the Gym&#8221; clip-art collection and the here-let-coolz0r-do-that-for-you-honey blogging wizard)
  * Windows Vista &#8220;Cool Premium&#8221; Edition (with instruction-DVD by Miel and a &#8216;slow mode&#8217; for blondes)

In any case: I wish Miel fascinating times at Microsoft!
