I complained back in 2004 that [Nokia didn&#8217;t have](http://blog.forret.com/2004/06/oh-nokia-wont-you-make-me-a-nice-mobile-phone/) any model that pleased me. I had used 5 Nokia mobile phones at that point, wanted to buy a new one and did&#8217;t find anything suitable. Some months later I bought me a Samsung 720: a small clamshell phone with a nice design, lots of features and unfortunately one main flaw: voice quality. The number of people that have asked me: &#8220;_are you in a tunnel or something? I can hardly hear you_&#8220;. Those days may be over.

Beause Nokia now has the opportunity to return with a vengeance. I have been asked by the kind people of [TheseDays](http://blog.thesedays.com/blog/2006/04/07/nokia-n91-a-music-lovers-wet-dream) to take the new [Nokia N91 phone](http://web.nseries.com/nseries/index.html) for an elaborate test drive. A phone with a 4GB hard drive and Wifi (802.11g) built-in, I wasn&#8217;t too difficult to convince.

So in the next couple of days I will be posting about my experiences with this 165g of high-tech. I am as curious as TheseDays whether I can be convinced to switch back to Nokia. Just a glance at the contenders: at your left, the Samsung E720,at your right the Nokia N91.

The Nokia N91 will be available in Belgium somewhere next month, the one I have seems to be #3 in the Benelux. Let&#8217;s find out if three is the magic number. In any way, a big thank you to TheseDays for qualifying me as &#8216;[an influential blogger](http://blog.thesedays.com/blog/2006/04/07/nokia-n91-a-music-lovers-wet-dream)&#8216; and letting me test this fancy piece of hardware.
