They propose a 4-label system, of which three indicate that smoking is still allowed under one or other form. The used colors are such that &#8220;no smoke ban at all&#8221; is green, and &#8220;smoking completely banned&#8221; is red. That is a dirty psychological trick: it gives the restaurant owners the impression they are turning people down with the red sign, and are being more hospitable with the green one.

On the contrary: I call upon all non-smokers to do as me and **not enter restaurants that still allow smoking**. It should be clear for the owners which smoking policy will scare away the most customers. The correct color coding should be the following:

But you might say _&#8220;and what about the restaurants that install ventilation systems? They shouldn&#8217;t be punished for that effort?&#8221;_ Well: ventilation systems are useless. Moreover they are dangerous because they give a false sense of security.

> &#8220;This study proves that dining in a restaurant or bar&#8217;s non-smoking section does not significantly reduce exposure to smoke-related pollutants, even in those few establishments that use these sophisticated, expensive ventilation systems,&#8221; says Repace, who is Adjunct Professor at Tufts University School of Medicine and a secondhand smoke consultant. &#8220;Smoking bans remain the only viable option that protects the health of non-smokers and hospitality workers.&#8221;
