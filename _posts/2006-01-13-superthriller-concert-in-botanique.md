Life is full of surprises and sometimes good ones too:  
The &#8220;[**Superthriller**](http://www.superthriller.co.uk/)&#8221; concert in the [Botanique](http://www.botanique.be/index.asp) was a blast. Never heard of the guys, just thought that the word &#8220;funk&#8221; in the concert announce was not a bad sign, but boy, what a discovery! Like they say on their site: a mix of Prince, Beck and Scissor Sisters, and they don&#8217;t take themselves too seriously at all.

> Keyboard player: &#8220;_The next song is by a very close friend of ours &#8230; John Lennon_.&#8221;  
> Singer: &#8220;_It&#8217;s called &#8216;Cold Turkey&#8217;_&#8220;  
> Crossdressing background singer: &#8220;_It&#8217;s a song about Christmas at my place_&#8220;

Or the song that started with &#8220;_This is a song about my girlfriend_&#8220;, and the song title turning out to be &#8220;_Fat Ass_&#8220;.  
Or the sensitive ballad on just piano and vocals: &#8220;_When the bitch gets cranky_&#8220;.  
We had fun.

Their album is called &#8220;Superthriller 1&#8221; (on [iTunes](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=64557357&s=143446) or [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/B0009OJAEO&tag=forretcom-21&camp=1634&creative=6738))

Here are some songs, but as good as they are, they&#8217;re no match for the live experience!
