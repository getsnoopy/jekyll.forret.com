While we were creating the [Pixagogo](http://www.pixagogo.com) site, we paid a lot of attention to optimal and correct search engine tuning. More specifically, [Bart _&#8220;SEO man&#8221;_ Anrijs](http://www.baare.com) read most documents available on the subject and handcarved the HTML until it was just right. It worked as expected, and we now have a very powerful (and legal!) tool to push stuff up high in Google rankings: the Pixagogo Public Albums. The basic idea is to create an album that is featured in the [Public Gallery](http://www.pixagogo.com/Photos/Albums/PhotoGallery.aspx). It won&#8217;t work for porn or other illegal material, because we check all candidates for public albums manually. 

We first noticed it with some of our own albums, like my [Skeemz album](http://www.pixagogo.com/6134235147), which ranks #1 for a [Google search on &#8216;Isolde Lasoen&#8217;](http://www.google.com/search?q=isolde+lasoen) and most of the names of the other band members, or Wim&#8217;s [honeymoon pictures album](http://www.pixagogo.com/0154395164), which scores excellent for &#8220;trouw foto&#8217;s&#8221;.  
So if you want to promote an artist, a site or want to show off your collection of Delfts aardewerk, here&#8217;s a good way to be found in Google, Yahoo and MSN: 

  * get a [Pixagogo](http://www.pixagogo.com/) account 
  * create a nice album with pictures of the subject you want to promote 
  * choose a relevant title, with the words you want to rank high on 
  * add links to your own site if you have one 
  * and submit it as a candidate for a public album.

If the album is accepted, wait a week or two and do a search on the words in the title. The results will even grow better in time. You can also check traffic on your album with the &#8216;Statistics&#8217; button.

TEST: This blog already ranks #1 if you search on &#8216;podcast icons&#8217;, so now I&#8217;ve created a [Pixagogo podcast icons album](http://www.pixagogo.com/5111825842) to see how long it will take for the album to jump ahead of this blog&#8217;s listing. Keeping my fingers crossed!

UPDATE 13 Jan 2005: the Pixagogo album just got [picked up by Google](http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&q=podcast+icons) and jumped right to the 2nd place, right behind my blog post. I&#8217;m curious to see whether it can jump ahead of it after a couple of weeks &#8230;
