[Moore&#8217;s Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) in the strict sense states that 

> The complexity for minimum component costs has increased at a rate of roughly a factor of two per year.

In the broadest sense, it can be used to say any computer hardware grows exponentially at some rate ([As Moore said](http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue7_11/tuomi/index.html): _&#8220;if Gore invented the Internet, I invented the exponential&#8221;_). It seems to be true for CPU speed, hard disk capacity, network bandwidth, RAM size &#8230; With some imagination it could even be true for laptop batteries: they double capacity every couple of decades (if we&#8217;re lucky). Eventhough [some claim Moore&#8217;s Law is no longer valid](http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm), let&#8217;s just assume it still is.

In an effort to keep track of the effect of Moore&#8217;s law on our own desktop, I will list the typical 2004 Christmas computer. The computer we are talking about is not a budget PC (you can get a Celeron-based PC for less than 700&euro;) nor a nec-plus-ultra workstation with SCSI disks, 2 Itanium processors and 4GB of RAM. It&#8217;s rather what would be listed as a &#8216;performance&#8217; PC. Spending 1500&euro; (about $2000) this Christmas would get you:

  * Intel Pentium 4 3.2 GHz or Athlon 3200+ 
  * 512 MB RAM (e.g. DDR PC3200) 
  * 128MB or 256MB graphical card (e.g. ATI Radeon X600, nVidia GeForce 6800) 
  * 160GB S-ATA hard disk with 8MB buffer (e.g. Maxtor Pax Plus 9) 
  * CD/DVD writer 
  * 6 USB 2.0, 1 FireWire 
  * 5.1 sound card 
  * 7-in-1 memory card reader 
  * Gigabit Ethernet 
  * 350 watt power supply 
  * 17&#8243; LCD monitor (1280&#215;1024) 
  * Windows XP Home 
  * Wireless optical keyboard + mouse

Blast from the past: 3 years ago (Jan 2002) a &#8216;performance&#8217; PC was more like 2000&euro; and looked like this:

  * Pentium 4 2GHz (17% increase per year) 
  * 256MB RAM (25% increase per year) 
  * 64MB graphical card (25% increase per year) 
  * 60GB hard disk (40% increase per year) 
  * DVD-ROM + CD-RW 
  * a 56K/V92 modem (!) 
  * 100Mbps Ethernet (these things go in steps of 10X) 
  * Keyboard + mouse with(!) scroll-button 
  * 17&#8243; CRT monitor (same size, only now they&#8217;re thinner) 
  * Windows XP Home (yes, it&#8217;s that old!)

If anyone can come up with numbers for Christmas 1998, that would be great!)

So let&#8217;s see what Santa brings us for Christmas 2005!
