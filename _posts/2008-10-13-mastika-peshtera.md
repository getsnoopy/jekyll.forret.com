I went to Bulgaria in August, and one of the things I remarked there is that standards for advertising are somewhat different over there. One of the champions is [Mastika Peshtera](http://www.questbg.com/en/lifestyle/fooddrink/585-mastika-a-bulgarian-aphrodisiac) (&#8220;Мастика Пещера&#8221; &#8211;  a.k.a. &#8216;_the Bulgarian afrodisiac_&#8216;). They use scantily dressed women and green striped melons on strategic places to stress the afrodisiac dimension. Imagine this type of advertising in Belgium. What would reactions be?
