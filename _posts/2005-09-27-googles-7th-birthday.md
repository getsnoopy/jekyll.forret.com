> In September 1998, [Google Inc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google). opened its door in Menlo Park, California. The door came with a remote control, as it was attached to the garage of a friend who sublet space to the new corporation&#8217;s staff of three. The office offered several big advantages, including a washer and dryer and a hot tub.

The baseline of the company might be &#8220;[don&#8217;t be evil](http://investor.google.com/conduct.html)&#8220;, but it actually should be something like &#8220;dare to dream&#8221;. What Larry Page and Sergey Brin have done a number of times already, is realize the improbable and seemingly insane in a market, redefine the standards of how things should be done, and kill off most of the competitors in one go.

  * Build a storage engine with thousands of cheap servers instead of dozens of expensive ones. ([Google File System](http://labs.google.com/papers/gfs.html) is an essential read) 
  * Deliver search results in less than a second: keep a [copy of all 8 billion pages in RAM memory](http://blog.topix.net/archives/000011.html). 
  * Give everyone a free email address with 1GB of space instead of 2MB (they can manage [the $2/GB cost](http://blog.topix.net/archives/000016.html)) 
  * Create a non-intrusive [contextual advertising system](http://www.google.com/adsense/) that is profitable 
  * Run the world&#8217;s [biggest outsourced content management system](http://www.blogger.com) as a free blogging service. 
  * Create a [mapping service](http://maps.google.com/) that is free, up-to-date and easy to integrate &#8211; and show the whole world the [AJAX way](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX). 
  * Provide [free wireless service](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9406935/) everywhere (this one is not confirmed, but God, it would be nice) 

A very happy birthday to Google, and I hope they stay around a whole while longer so they can shake up the establishment.
