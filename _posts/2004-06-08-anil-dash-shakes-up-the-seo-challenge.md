Wow, this is a nice surprise. Anil Dash, from Six Apart/Movable Type/TypePad, decides to enter the SEO Challenge 3 days before the first milestone, and with a little help from whole bunch of bloggers jumps to **position 1** just a day late. The self-publishing community has had to fight of the annoyances of the commercial SEO hackers (comment spam, wiki spam, &#8230;) and now shows them who&#8217;s still driving the Google train.

Here&#8217;s Anil Dash&#8217;s page for the [nigritude ultramarine](http://www.dashes.com/anil/2004/06/04/nigritude_ultra) contest. 

Good for you, Anil! Keep it up until July 7th!
