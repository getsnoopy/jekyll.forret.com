Yesterday, while waiting for the [Parelvissers](http://www.parelvissers.be) to start on [één](http://www.een.be/televisie1_master/programmas/e_pare_programma/index.shtml), my zapping pattern made me stumble upon 

  * [Big Brother](http://bb.belbone.be/home.php): some &#8216;grown-ups&#8217; were fishing rubber ducks out of a pool with forced enthusiasm
  * [De Pfaffs](http://www.vtm.be/tv/index_programma_de_pfaffs.htm): 2 &#8216;grown-up&#8217; men couldn&#8217;t work out how to install a game console and resorted to drinking half a dozen beers out of a home tap, in glasses featuring the face of their father-in-law (Jean-Marie Pfaff, Belgium&#8217;s best example of &#8216;brains don&#8217;t matter&#8217;)

Ironically, the excellent &#8216;Parelvissers&#8217; show is about the decay of a formerly successful TV production company that falls apart because they produce more and more shitty stuff. I wonder how many of the people in [Endemol](http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemol) (Big Brother) or [Eyeworks](http://www.eyeworks.tv/) (de Pfaffs) have a déjà-vu feeling when watching the series. &#8220;_A show that features old people reading their will on TV and explaining why cousin X doesn&#8217;t get anything, hey, we had that idea too!_&#8220;. 

Watching Big Brother for 5 minutes was bad enough, but the Pfaffs episode was really embarrassing. Two guys in their late twenties fruitlessly struggling with a game console and a huge flat screen, a pregnant daughter talking to her doctor about her stool inconsistency, a 50-year ex-goalie talking about the importance of friendship while wearing sponsored shirts, &#8230; there&#8217;s just that much a sensible person can take. This is [Reality television](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television) when the genre has outstayed its welcome, when they&#8217;re just trying to milk a dead cow. Reality TV is dead. Let&#8217;s see what&#8217;s on the other channels &#8230;
