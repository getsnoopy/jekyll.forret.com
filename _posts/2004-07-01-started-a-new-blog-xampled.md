I&#8217;ve started a new blog on one of my pet topics: usage of samples in music. Being a fan of house and R&B music, I&#8217;ve always been thrilled when I discovered the original source of an irresistible break or groove. Apart from copyright issues that I will bluntly ignore here, sampling has changed the music landscape significantly. We would be amazed at how many times we hear James Brown, Barry White and Roy Ayers bits &#8216;n pieces in today&#8217;s music.  
I also did not find an extensive list of sample references yet on the Net. Some sites have information on one artist, some on one genre and you&#8217;re forced to do some creative Googling in order to find who sampled what.

So, as a way of recording my searches for the originals and as a tribute to some truely gifted artists, here&#8217;s the all new [Xampled Blog](http://www.xampled.com/ "Xampled - Creative Reusage of Memorable Samples").
