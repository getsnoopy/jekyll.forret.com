It first jumped into my ear via [Pentdego](http://www.pentdego.com/)&#8216;s [MixOfTheWeek](http://www.ipodder.org/directory/4/podcasts/categories/music/electronicaDance/pentdegoMixes) mixes podcast: the irresistible first number on the DJ Fiskars January mix (originally featured on [MOTW Forum](http://mixoftheweek.com/board/read.php?f=1&i=16364&t=16364)). 

In the mix it is preceded by 10 seconds of [&#8220;Are You My Woman&#8221; (The Chi-Lites)](http://www.xampled.com/blog/sampled-from/the-chi-lites/), the famous sample used in &#8220;Crazy In Love&#8221; by Beyonce. They do sound alike: the minimal instrumentation, the prominent drums, the chord chop on the first beat of every 4 bars . No big surprise there, as I found out later, both songs were created by the same guy: [Rich Harrisson](http://www.emimusicpub.com/worldwide/artist_profile/rich-harrison_profile.html). 

[Studio Brussel is pushing the song](http://www.stubru.be/stubru_master/muziek/singles/200503_week2/index.html) this week: &#8220;**One Thing**&#8221; by [**Amerie**](http://www.amerie.net/). There&#8217;s a video clip on her [MTV](http://www.mtv.com/bands/az/amerie/artist.jhtml) page. As nice as her legs might be, it&#8217;s a pity she&#8217;s blocking the view of the drummer, who lays down a nice [Clyde Stubblefield-ish](http://www.xampled.com/xampled/2004/09/xampled-funky-drummer-james-brown.html) groove. The song is featured on the soundtrack of &#8220;[Hitch](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386588/)&#8220;, and that movie is just being [released here in chilly Brussels](http://www.cinebel.be/nl/film.asp?Code_film=12966).
