The trip to London for the Carson &#8220;[Future of Web Apps](http://carsonworkshops.com/summit/)&#8221; Summit was well worth the trouble.  
What did we learn:

  * _Travelling to London by car with [Eurotunnel](http://www.eurotunnel.com/) is cheap, easy and flexible. Plus, driving on the left for a while adds a sense of adventure. (Roundabouts rock!)_ 
  * _If you arrive only 10 minutes before the [Eurostar](http://www.eurostar.com/) leaves, that&#8217;s too late, as [Francois and Denis](http://www.shoob.com/fr/blog/archives/carsonworkshops/future_of_web_apps_mes_photos_en_ligne.html) discovered._ 
  *![](http://static.flickr.com/40/97830388_0d71bdae69_m.jpg) >> [**Joshua Schachter**](http://burri.to/~joshua/) from [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us):  
    minimal presentation (1 line per slide) but lots of good &#8216;lessons-learned&#8217; while starting up del.icio.us. I particularly liked: add lots of caching when possible, latency is OK is some places, decide on how much community you want to build in, don&#8217;t make stuff too easy, use consistent grammar and design conventions, respect data ownership.  
    &#8220;_Idiots are a lot smarter than you_&#8220;</p> 
  *![](http://static.flickr.com/41/97830568_9b438eff75_m.jpg) >> [**Cal Henderson**](http://www.iamcal.com/) from [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com):  
    the minimal trend continues (each slide is a picture from Flickr with 1 word)! No real new info, but entertaining presentation. He claims AJAX should be named &#8216;A&#8217; because it&#8217;s not always JavaScript and not always XML. Why anyone would develop in A**V**AX (using VBscript, and restricting supported clients to only IE) is anyone&#8217;s guess.  
    &#8220;_Flickr is massively multiplayer online photo sharing_&#8220;</p> 
  *<img src="http://static.flickr.com/29/97831027_6b916e809b_m.jpg" border="0" /> >> [**Tom Coates**](http://www.plasticbag.org/) from [Yahoo!](http://www.yahoo.com/):  
    good speaker, great speech. His &#8216;[URL fetishist](http://www.flickr.com/photos/redux/97126279)&#8216; confession will surely haunt him for a while. I liked the concept of &#8216;first order objects&#8217;.  
    &#8220;_Browse the news by things that happened to capricorns_&#8220;</p> 
  * _Lunch with some of the Belgian attendees: [Bart](http://www.ondernemeringent.be/2006/02/wifi-in-londen.html), [Werner](http://jroller.com/page/werner?entry=who_is_interested_working_in), [Yoeri](http://www.yappa.be/), [Jesse](http://blog.f4l.be/), [Mathias](http://www.memenco.com/cablevisor/) en enige-meid-in-de-bijt [Ine](http://mastuvu.typepad.com/). Pizza and pasta in less than 45 minutes._ 
  *<img src="http://static.flickr.com/41/97831535_158ef63d88_m.jpg" border="0" /> >> [**David Heinemeier Hansson**](http://www.loudthinking.com/) from [37signals](http://www.37signals.com/)  
    [Not a new presentation](http://www.djangoproject.com/snakesandrubies/), but [RubyOnRails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) remains a remarkably sexy developer&#8217;s framework, and David a funny presenter. &#8220;Flexibility is overrated&#8221;, &#8220;PHP is the devil&#8221;, &#8230; The presentation was filled with great one-liners.  
    &#8220;_One question: Does it scale? Answer: Yes_&#8220;</p> 
  * >> [**Shaun Inman**](http://www.shauninman.com/) from [Mint](http://www.haveamint.com/):  
    talked about the importance of having APIs with the concrete example of Mint (web statistics software) and the possibility to add &#8216;Peppers&#8217;. </p> 
  * >> Andrew Shorten from [Adobe](http://www.macromedia.com/software/flex/): wrong topic, wrong tone, wrong conference. That about covers it. 
  *<img src="http://static.flickr.com/24/97832100_6db4498042_m.jpg" border="0" /> >> [**Ryan Carson**](http://www.carsonsystems.com/) from [Dropsend](http://www.dropsend.com/):  
    interesting talk and interesting slide design. Ryan spent £26.000 to build DropSend and explains where the money went.  
    _&#8220;Holy Crap, lawyers are expensive!&#8221;_</p> 
  * >> [**Steffen Meschkat**](http://googlemapsapi.blogspot.com/) from [Google](http://www.google.com):  
    Steffen worked on Google Maps and helped develop the AJAX interface. He certainly knows his `XMLHttpRequest` inside out. &#8216;SSSS&#8217; stands for Server Side Session State. So if it unexpectedly suspends all all servers without notification, that would be a Sudden Silent Synchronised Server Side Session State Suspension (or SSSSSSSS). He loses me when he dives in the browser inconsistencies.  
    &#8220;_Javascript: what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger_.&#8221;</p> 
  * >> **Panel discussion**  
    [Steve Olechowski](http://www.burningdoor.com/lineofsite/) from [FeedBurner](http://www.feedburner.com) announces the [FeedFlare API](http://www.burningdoor.com/feedburner/archives/001636.html). The first &#8211; and according to Ryan the best &#8211; question is &#8220;_Many web apps are very specialised. Is the future of the web about focused tools?_&#8220;. 
  * _<img src="http://static.flickr.com/19/98192290_15005fd34c_m.jpg" border="0" />Although London is an expensive city, the [Tate Modern museum](http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/) is free and as such worth even more than every penny: Rodin, Dali, Mondriaan, Picasso and then some less obscure dudes. (Picture by [Ine](http://www.flickr.com/photos/matuvu/98192290))_ 
  * _Travelling back to Belgium was even more fun, because there was no need to rush and conversation was even better. Felt like auto-pilot and then we were in Gent._ 

_All pictures are by [Paperjam](http://www.flickr.com/photos/12401974@N00/sets/72057594062081604/) except where indicated._
