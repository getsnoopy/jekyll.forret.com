Brussels in the sun, what a pleasure. Some glasses of white wine, listening to music on a &#8216;terraske&#8217; with some friends, yesterday was really a nice day. Certainly with the pleasant contribution of Skeemz, a Ghent-based band that played funky hip-hop/R&B music. Good lyrics, a cute singer with a great soulful voice and a young but skilled band that was obviously having fun. Supported by my favourite female drummer of the moment, Isolde Lasoen. She plays in so many bands ([Skeemz](http://www.skeemz.be), [Bruno de Bruxelles](http://www.brunodebruxelles.be/), [Briskey](http://www.briskey.be), [Daan](http://www.daan.be), &#8230;) so she&#8217;s actually hard to avoid on live concerts. Next appointment: _Daan_ in Brussels on May 29th.
