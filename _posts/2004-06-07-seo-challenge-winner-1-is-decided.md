The 1st winner of the [SEO Challenge](http://www.seochallenge.com/) (2nd winner is decided on July 7th) is forums.merkey.net, with their mangled forum. Can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m too happy with that, they used a bunch of dirty tricks to get there ([wiki spamming](http://blog.outer-court.com/forum/73.html), gibberish content, pissing off their own users, &#8230;). I hope the 2nd price goes to a contestant that plays by the rules, like [blog.outer-court.com](http://blog.outer-court.com/), [www.nigritudeultramarines.com](http://www.nigritudeultramarines.com) or [internet-marketing-research.net](http://www.internet-marketing-research.net/forums/ftopic7991.html).

The Top 5 on June 7th was:

  1. **forums.merkey.net** 
  2. blog.outer-court.com 
  3. sim64.co.uk 
  4. geneostar.com 
  5. internet-marketing-research.net
