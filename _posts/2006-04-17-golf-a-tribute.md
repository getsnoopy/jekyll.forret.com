A friend of mine, Kurt Deruyter, has just spent most of last year travelling around Europe taking pictures of the most idyllic golf courses. How's that for a job? The result is not just any photo book, but [the biggest coffee-table book on golf](http://www.golfatribute.com/) ever published. Funny detail: when you buy a copy, you actually get a coffee table with it. The book, when opened, measures 60 cm by 140 cm (22.6 inch by 55.1 inch).

Does it come cheap? Well, golf isn't exactly a sport for the poor and the needy, is it? The most common version comes at 4.400 euro, and the &#8220;Club edition&#8221; (26 copies worldwide) is a hefty 10.000 euro. Although there is one copy [on display in the Brussels&#8217; FNAC](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/125613537/), I guess the typical customer would a wealthy golf player or probably even golf club.  

The pictures are stunning and the book was obviously made with the best materials. It can be ordered from [Booksinspired](http://www.booksinspired.com).
