I just created a new [WinAdmin](http://winadmin.forret.com)script to do XSL Transforms, and while I was at it, also updated some older scripts. 

The results:<img style="float: right" src="http://www.forret.com/forret/forret_pc_bg.gif" alt="Winadmin Utilities" />

  * [waXslt](http://winadmin.forret.com/scripts/waxslt/) (NEW): to perform an XSL Transform on an XML file
  * [waNoCaps](http://winadmin.forret.com/registry/wanocaps/) (UPDATED): the most popular &#8211; and the simplest &#8211; of all my utilities, to disable your CAPSLOCK key
  * [waRmZip](http://winadmin.forret.com/scripts/warmzip/) (UPDATED): 2nd most popular, to clean up folders by deleting, moving, rotating or compressing files.
  * [waTemplate](http://winadmin.forret.com/templates/wsf-template/) (UPDATED): WSF template script, includes parameter parsing, logging
