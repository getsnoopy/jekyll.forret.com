I&#8217;m gonna be responsible for managing a mini-backstage at the [Pukkelpop](http://www.pukkelpop.be) festival this Thursday, Friday, Saturday. Mini-backstage means: the small hide-out right next to the more distant stages, where artists take their preparatory beers and coffees right before they perform. Since I did not choose my own schedule, I&#8217;m going to take care of a bunch of people I&#8217;ve mostly never heard of:

Thursday &#8211; &#8216;Club&#8217; stage</p> 
:   Adam Green &#8211; Blood Brothers &#8211; The Departure</p> 
    
    Friday &#8211; &#8216;Wablief&#8217; stage</p> 
    
    :   Millionaire &#8211; El Guapo Stuntteam &#8211; Vandal X</p> 
        
        Saturday &#8211; &#8216;Chateau&#8217; stage</p> 
        
        :   Vincent Gallo &#8211; The Dresden Dolls &#8211; Whitey

But with some luck, my shift will be over when Jamie Lidell plays on the Chateau stage on Thursday. Might be a bit tight, but &#8220;that&#8217;s the use of figuring it all out&#8221; (#5 on the &#8220;Multiply&#8221; CD &#8211; addictive)!
