Not that I&#8217;m particularly sad today, but I was recently thinking about the music I play over and over again on less happy days. For some reason, it&#8217;s still the same songs I play as 10-15 years ago. So now that we have Youtube:

> I play out my role  
> Why I&#8217;ve even been out walking  
> They tell me that it helps  
> But I know when I&#8217;m beaten  
> All those lonely films  
> And all those lonely parties  
> But now the feeling is off-screen  
> An the tears for real not acted, anymore
> 
> &#8220;Long Hot Summer&#8221; (1983) &#8211; [Style Council](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Style_Council) (with Paul Weller on Bass)

> Those were days of roses,  
> Poetry and prose and Martha  
> All I had was you and all you had was me.  
> There was no tomorrows,  
> Wed packed away our sorrows  
> And we saved them for a rainy day.

> &#8220;Martha&#8221; (1973) &#8211; [Tom Waits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Waits) (no original on Youtube, so I give you a cover by &#8216;Malvasio&#8217;)

This last song I only discovered in the 90s (on the excellent &#8220;Closing Time&#8221; album), but I remember the other two from when they came out, both around 1983. I guess the memories from when you&#8217;re 14 are really strong.

So what songs come out of your stereo on sad days?

Â UPDATE: I forgot one: &#8220;It&#8217;s too late&#8221; by Carole King

> It used to be so easy living here with you  
> You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do  
> Now you look so unhappy and I feel like a fool
> 
> And it&#8217;s too late, baby, now it&#8217;s too late  
> Though we really did try to make it  
> Something inside has died  
> And I can&#8217;t hide and I just can&#8217;t fake it
