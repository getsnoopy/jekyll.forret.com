Sarah Brown is a free-lance writer from NYC. Judging from her blog, [Que Sera Sera](http://queserasera.org), she&#8217;s the kind of woman you&#8217;d like to have on your team in any verbal combat. Switching back and forth between self-mockery and sarcasm with the occasional pinch of misanthropy, she transform the small bumps in her life into amusing tales of (kind of) good and (mostly) evil.

She also hosts a reading series [Cringe](http://queserasera.org/cringe.html) in New York: &#8220;_brave souls come forward and read aloud from their teenage diaries, journals, notes, letters, poems, abandoned rock operas, and other general representations of the crushing misery of their humiliating adolescence_&#8220;.

In the next part she details her advanced seduction skills:

> Originally it was just me being rude, but now that I know where it’s coming from, it’s combined with a powerful middle school urge to hide in a closet whenever I see him coming, and if I can’t, I just say the meanest thing that pops into my head. I get fucking flustered and I hate it. For some reason, he keeps talking to me, but I fear that if it ever progresses to the point where he goes for the lean in, I might end up breaking his kneecaps before I can stop myself. This makes me nervous when he tries to make small talk, and then I end up blurting out things like, “What, were you raised in an orphanage?” And I don’t say this in a playful or sarcastic way: it comes out of my mouth in this disdainful, curt tone like I am seriously insinuating that his parents gave him away when he was an infant because they didn’t want him. But oh man, apparently I do.
