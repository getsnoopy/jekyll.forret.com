[Ief](http://ief.typepad.com/chow/2008/04/dude.html)Â points me to Budweiser&#8217;s [Dude Madness](http://www.dudemadness.com/), the new campaign for Budweiser Lite. One of my best friends always calls me &#8216;dude&#8217;, so I&#8217;m familiar with the dozens of intonations and innuendos that can be communicated through it.

Test your dudeness, too. I&#8217;m an Estro Dude.

Here are all the commercials. I specifically like the Vegas one.
