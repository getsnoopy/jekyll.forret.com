I just finished another webpage for my [forret.com tools collection](http://www.forret.com/tools/): the [Adwords Generator tool](http://www.forret.com/tools/adwords.asp). Inspired by seeing a colleague losing his time with Excel trying to create a full list of keywords for his Google Adsense campaigns, I created an easy web interface to do just that: give in lists of keywords of key phrases, and let the [Adwords tool](http://www.forret.com/tools/adwords.asp) create all the possible combinations. 

You would use it in this way: say you want to promote a podcast client application for Windows (like the [new Doppler 3.0](http://www.dopplerradio.net/)).

  * you would use the 1st box to list &#8216;podcast&#8217; and all its synonyms:  
    _podcast, audioblog, mp3 blog_ 
  * you would use the 2nd box to list all synonyms for &#8216;client&#8217;  
    _client, podcatcher, aggregator, downloader, viewer_ 
  * you could use the 3rd box to list the versions of Windows your software runs on:  
    _Windows 2000 (or Win2k), Windows XP (or WinXP), Windows 2003 (or Win2003)_ 

Combining everything together gives you a list of 90 keyphrases: [Adsense keywords for a Windows podcast client](http://www.forret.com/tools/adwords.asp?title=Windows+podcast+client&lines1=podcast%0D%0Aaudioblog%0D%0Amp3+blog&lines2=client%0D%0Apodcatcher%0D%0Aaggregator%0D%0Adownloader%0D%0Aviewer&lines3=Windows+2000%0D%0AWin2K%0D%0AWindows+XP%0D%0AWinXP%0D%0AWindows+2003%0D%0AWin2003). You can even add the &#8220;phrase matching&#8221; or [exact matching] options (see [adwords.google.com](http://adwords.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=6100&hl=en_US) for more info). 

You can also look up suggestions for new keywords through tools from [Google Adsense](https://adwords.google.com/) and [Yahoo Search Marketing (formerly Overture)](http://searchmarketing.yahoo.com/). A nice addition to my toolbox!
