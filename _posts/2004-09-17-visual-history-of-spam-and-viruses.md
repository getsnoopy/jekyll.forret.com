[Raymond Chen](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing) from Microsoft has been saving all his spam and virus mails since 1997 and created a graphical representation of them: a dot per mail in time/size coordinates.

Some of his observations:

>   * Spam went ballistic starting in 2002. You could see it growing in 2001, but 2002 was when it really took off. 
>   * The big red splotch in August 2003 around the 100K mark is the Sobig virus.
>   * The horizontal line in 2004 that wanders around the 2K mark is the Netsky virus.
