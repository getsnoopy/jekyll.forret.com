I&#8217;ve got a habit of every now and then making tiny web applications to solve some issue/challenge I encounter. <del datetime="2006-09-14T15:23:28+00:00">I call these Hizmo&#8217;s, for lack of a better term. (You have to be Belgian to get this typo).</del>

The last one I made is called [StereoSearch](http://web.forret.com/tools/stereosearch.asp), an interface for searching search engines at the same time with the same keywords. They are in 2 separate windows side-by-side, so you can easily compare the top 5. I use it to compare Yahoo and Google results, and to test the new GigaBlast search engine. Again, no rocket science, just handy.

Older Hizmo&#8217;s are:

  * [LoginForm generator](http://web.forret.com/tools/login.asp): for creating a minimal login screen for HotMail, Google, &#8230; 
  * [DisciplineBrowser](http://web.forret.com/tools/): OK, this one was for fun. It allows you to browse the web for defined # of minutes and then alerts you to go back to work. 
  * [HTTPHeader Analyzer](http://web.forret.com/tools/analyze.aspx): show HTTP headers (I made this one while working with caching servers) 
  * [WorldSpeed tester](http://web.forret.com/tools/speed.asp): tests your connection speed to different parts of the world. 

UPDATE: these tools are now on [web.forret.com](http://web.forret.com/)!
