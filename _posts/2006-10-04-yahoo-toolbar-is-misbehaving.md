Eventhough it claims to help you detect and remove spyware, the Yahoo! Toolbar &#8211; now included/suggested in lots of freeware downloads ([Flash](http://www.bubblegeneration.com/2005/03/evil-macromedia-bundling-yahoos.cfm),)- practically behaves as a piece of adware itself.

I subscribed to a Yahoo Group (for [Flickr users in Brussels](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/flickr_brussels/)) and the first time I wanted to access the group&#8217;s homepage, I got an ActiveX popup for the Yahoo toolbar. I know I don&#8217;t need the toolbar to see the homepage, but I guess a lot of people will think they do, and click &#8216;Yes&#8217; automatically. I installed it too to see how aggressive the toolbar would be afterwards.

[<img loading="lazy" src="http://static.flickr.com/99/260634030_6ac3951538.jpg" style="float: right" width="357" height="500" alt="yahoo toolbar" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/260634030/ "Photo Sharing")The toolbar shuts down all your IE windows after installation, and a new window appears with the new toolbar. It features spyware protection (with Norton security), multiple tabs, Yahoo! Search and Yahoo! Mail/Messenger integration. It tries to set your homepage and preferred search engine to Yahoo! but I did not allow that. The toolbar takes up quite a bit of screen real estate, with the tabs and all.

Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re like me, and you&#8217;re not that impressed with the toolbar (I use [Google&#8217;s toolbar](http://toolbar.google.com/) and am quite happy with it). You would start with disabling the Yahoo! toolbar (View -> Toolbars). Much to your surprise, the next IE window you open, the toolbar would reappear. Even when you open a link in a new window: there&#8217;s the toolbar. Now that&#8217;s pretty annoying. 

The best way to go is to remove it completely:  
Start -> Settings -> Control Panel -> Add/Remove Programs -> Yahoo! Toolbar for IE

I&#8217;m not saying that Yahoo! is evil, but the way their toolbar is promoted and the way it keeps popping up even when you don&#8217;t want it to, reminds me a lot of &#8216;shopping toolbars&#8217; and other malware. Certainly if they want to promote it as a tool to combat spyware and adware, they might do some effort to behave correctly too.
