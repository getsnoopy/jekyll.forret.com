I remember when I saw my first double-neck guitar, I was really impressed. That seemed like a huge thing to have hanging from your neck. They became really popular in the Led Zeppelin, Yes and The Who era. The idea is to have 2 guitars handy, like a 6-string and a 12-string, or a bass and a guitar, a fretted and a fretless bass, or 2 guitars in a different tuning. But obviously it&#8217;s also one of those macho &#8216;size-matters&#8217; things. The guitarist with the double-neck here is Jimmy Page from Led Zeppelin.

There&#8217;s more, of course: e.g. Steve Vai has played the triple-neck heart-shaped monster you see on the side.

> Today, triple neck guitars are still rare, because they&#8217;re huge, heavy, expensive and utterly pointless. They&#8217;re an obscene symbol of self-indulgence, like Missy Elliot&#8217;s Lamborghini bed, or Snoop&#8217;s jewel-encrusted crunk cup.

King of the hill: the quintuple-neck guitar, used by Cheap Trick&#8217;s Rick Nielsen. That is: 36 strings (4 guitars and a 12 string). Respect!
