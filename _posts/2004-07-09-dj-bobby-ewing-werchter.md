I&#8217;ve seen a couple of DJs at the [Werchter](http://www.rockwerchter.be) festival, of varying quality. [Discobar Galaxie](http://www.discobargalaxie.be) organised in-between-acts DJ sets with guest DJs under the name &#8216;Galaxie Gangbang Soundsystem&#8217;. [DJ 4T4](http://www.dj4t4.com) showed up, [TLP](http://www.stubru.be/stubru_master/programmas/presentatoren/tlp/), [Buscemi](http://www.buscemi.be/) and others. But the best DJ was -again- [Bobby Ewing](http://www.stubru.be/stubru_master/programmas/hang_the_dj/homedjbobbyewing/). A superb taste in grooves, an impeccable technique and he always looks like he has everything under control. 

He&#8217;s worked for radio ([Hang the DJ](http://www.stubru.be/stubru_master/programmas/hang_the_dj/home/) on Studio Brussel), is active in Discobar Galaxie and the [BreakBeatles](http://www.djfactory.be/djbio.asp?DJ_ID=27) and has started doing some remix work. The ones I know of are:

  * Bandy bandy &#8211; ZAP MAMA 
  * Ready &#8211; SKEEMZ 
  * Gossip Children &#8211; MISSY ELLIOT VS SCOTTY 
  * Geheiligd Zij De Coach &#8211; PIKKEDONKER 
    Check out some of his sets on [Hang The DJ &#8211; DJ Bobby Ewing](http://www.stubru.be/stubru_master/programmas/hang_the_dj/homedjbobbyewing/index.html).</li>
