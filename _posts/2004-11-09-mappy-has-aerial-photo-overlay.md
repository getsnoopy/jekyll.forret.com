They might already have it for a while, but I hadn&#8217;t noticed: [Mappy.com](http://www.mappy.com) can add an aerial picture of the neighbourhood you are searching. The street map is then overlayed on the aerial picture and you have a slider to manage the transparency of the street map. I stopped using Maporama one year back, because Mappy was just better but I hadn&#8217;t realised how much better.

See the above result for my neighborhood ([Marolles](http://www.pixagogo.com/1156595142), Brussels). 

You can see Rue Blaes & Rue Haute, the Breughel place, Place Poelaert, the Palais de Justice on the bottom right, a tip of the Vossenmarkt/Place Jeu de Bal in the left bottom corner.
