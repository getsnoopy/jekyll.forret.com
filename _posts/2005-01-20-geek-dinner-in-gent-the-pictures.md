Exactly what a geek dinner should be like: someone </a>[blogging with a Treo 600](http://maarten.typepad.com/), someone [with a copy of Star Wars on his phone](http://www.pmalog.net/) (no one using a phone for calling, actually), some [people](http://veerle.duoh.com) [defending](http://www.baeyens.net) Apple, someone defending Windows (that would be me) and lots of people taking pictures.

I&#8217;ve put my pictures in a [**www.pixagogo.com album**](http://www.pixagogo.com/8182785208), those who were there and also have some pictures they want to share, can upload them to the album with the &#8220;Upload&#8221; button after the last picture, or by sending them to me, peter.forret \_at\_ gmail.com.

Thx to [Cindy and Erwin, the Doppler crew](http://www.dopplerradio.net), for organising this event, and I hope it won&#8217;t be the last!

Update 20/01: there are also pictures on the blog of [Luc](http://www.lvb.net) and [Cindy](http://www.smetty.be).
