M-Audio just released the [FastTrack USB](http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/FastTrackUSB-main.html), a break-out box for recording guitar and voice. Looks like they made a [GuitarPort](http://www.guitarport.com) clone, but with a more &#8216;serious&#8217; design. That is: a basic A/D converter with a jack input and a USB output, and a bunch of effect software for your computer.  
A quick comparison:

| ----------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Price:      | $129                       | $99                        |
| Input:      | 1/4&#8243; jack, line, XLR | 1/4&#8243; jack            |
| Controller: | gain, input, output        | output                     |
| Software:   | GT Player Express (1.0?)   | GuitarPort 2.5 + RiffWorks |
| Platform:   | Windows/Mac                | Windows                    |

I currently own a GuitarPort and I love it. It does an awesome &#8216;Smoke on the water&#8217; and &#8216;Long train running&#8217;, and it works without a glitch. The FX software shows every effect (noise gate, delay, reverb, phaser, &#8230;) as an amp frontpanel. I just upgraded to the 2.5 software. At first sight, they added a parametric equalizer, a metronome and they finally figured out it made sense to group the presets in genres. You gotta love [Line6](http://www.line6.com): they sell people great hardware and keep giving them better software for free every couple of months.  
I also have an [M-Audio Ozone](http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/MAudioOzone-main.html) and that has been a bit of a disappointment. The latency of the MIDI controller is way too big, and the keyboard seems to lose its USB connection every couple of minutes, which makes for a stack of warning windows if you leave the PC alone for an hour. Anyway, I&#8217;m going to upgrade my DAW PC to Windows XP and see if it works any better.
