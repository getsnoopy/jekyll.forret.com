This [Intelligence Test](http://intelligence-test.net/part1/?m=2) was fun to do, and I got stuck at 23, without Googling or reverse-engineering the JS code. Then of course, somebody decided to comment on the [NoDesktopHero post](http://www.ferket.com/jvlt/archive/2008-07-28/intelligence_test) with spoilers. So yeah, no point in continuing.
