### Nsights

I got invited by [Nokia](http://www.nokia.be/) to talk a bit about podcasting and music discovery. The results of that interview, combined with opinions of [Clo Willaerts](http://www.bnox.be), Alex Koprivnicanec, Steven Lemmens and Dieter Sermeus, can be found on the [Nokia Nsights blog](http://www.nsights.be/). Instead of just creating a sales brochure for [their N95 phone](http://www.nseries.com/index.html#l=products,n95), Nokia created a place where new technologies and trends are discussed, thus touching the bleeding edge of Internet, music, photo, video, and GPS usage. The perfect positioning for a state-of-the-art phone like the N95.

> Today, the Nokia N95 starts a new and exciting future, building on the combination of all these revolutionary devices. Therefore, weâ€™ve invited visionaries from across the technology world to share their insights into different parts of the future that got here early.
