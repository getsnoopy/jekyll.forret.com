Great post on Steve Gadd on [MetaFilter](http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/32962). He&#8217;s one of the reasons I wanted to start drumming, after hearing him on Simon & Garfunkel&#8217;s &#8220;Concert in Central Park&#8221;. When I started browsing through the [Steve Gadd Grooves and Fills](http://www.intrepidsoftware.com/sgadd/grooves.php), I discovered that he was also responsible for &#8220;Chuck E&#8217;s In Love&#8221; (Rickie Lee Jones) and &#8220;Stuff Like That&#8221; (Quincy Jones). Tunes that got stuck in my head. He&#8217;s probably on more of my CDs than I can imagine. Janis Ian, Michael Franks, Al Jarreau, Michael McDonald, Steely Dan, &#8230;

I wonder who his worthy counterpart would be as a bass player (in my collection, then). Tony Levin? Pino Palladino? [Anthony Jackson](http://archive.bassplayer.com/artists/jackson1.shtml)? My vote would go to the latter.

Nice follow-up at [mrfeinberg.com](http://mrfeinberg.com/blog/archives/000009.html).
