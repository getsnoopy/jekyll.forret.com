Small rant ahead:

One of Flanders&#8217; fine actors, Peter Van Asbroeck, has let his hair grow. Way too long. And to make sure he doesn&#8217;t get any between his teeth, he has resorted to wearing a head band. Not a macho type of hair band &#8211; as far as that is possible &#8211; but the most sissy of hairbands: the stretching &#8216;diadem&#8217; (we call them &#8216;diadeem&#8217;). For a guy that puts &#8216;Miami Vice&#8217;-like pictures on [his website](http://www.petervanasbroeck.com/), takes pride in showing of his muscles &#8211; and as of more recently, his beer bulge &#8211; that is a surprising decision.

The newspaper &#8220;[Het Volk](http://www.hetvolk.be/Article/Detail.aspx?articleID=g0jj1u34)&#8221; &#8211; hardly an authority in the &#8216;style&#8217; department &#8211; claims that, while it might be oldfashioned for a girl to wear a diadem nowadays, it&#8217;s really trendy for men:

> It started with top footballers like Beckham, Totti and Ronaldinho, and got picked by other stars and now also by &#8216;the common man&#8217;. On Belgian soil we already spotted Bosko Balaban, Patrick Nijs and Daniel Van Buyten on the football court and in showbizz Werner Desmedt and Peter Van Asbroeck.

OK, let&#8217;s take a look:

Well, footballers and hairdressers, what can I say. These are the people that brought us the [mullet](http://www.mulletsgalore.com/), which -over here- has for years been the best indicator of football aspirations. Even better than walking round in a training suit 24/7 and driving a Manta.

So Mr. Van Asbroeck, I don&#8217;t know who told you you looked cool or cute with the headband, but it makes my skin crawl every time I see you on Thuis or Swingpaleis. Get it over with: Cut the hair, get a belly piercing or a brazilian wax, whatever rocks your boat. Just as long as I don&#8217;t have to see it.
