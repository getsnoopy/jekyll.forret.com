On paper it must have seemed a guaranteed winner: 

  * Oliver Stone as director: not that active as of lately &#8211; true &#8211; but responsible for blockbusters like JFK, Wall Street, Platoon and Born on the 4th of July 
  * a strong story of battle, success and leadership with a clear super-hero 
  * Colin Farell (as Alexander): the Irish bloke who became the receptionists&#8217; hero after hanging on the phone for over an hour in &#8220;[Phone Booth](http://imdb.com/title/tt0183649/)&#8221; 
  * Angelina Jolie (as his mom, Olympias): the predator babe with the luscious lips and the excellent performing C-cup 
  * Anthony Hopkins (as Ptolemy): any director&#8217;s first choice for playing an old man in a movie 
  * Val Kilmer (as Philip, Alexander&#8217;s father): the pilot with the chewing gum in [Top Gun](http://imdb.com/title/tt0092099/) 
  *![](http://us3.pixagogo.com/S5!bRz4QtUrC-k7jK55lp5hWMRTUXVjviJRfrA-p-8HFIf7RbbwcHJhL5Zzq6agnPl38SCnbi!RbkTbwOWzuAWq4-JW9fYvqkzMvkqUZJDOoY_/rosario_2.jpg) [Rosario Dawson](http://imdb.com/name/nm0206257/) (as Alexander&#8217;s ravishing wife Roxane): who also played in &#8220;[Kids](http://imdb.com/title/tt0113540/)&#8221; and surely has &#8216;grown&#8217; in more than one sense of the word! 
  * some B and C-list actors like Christopher Plummer and Jared Leto &#8230;

But the result is a disaster. What will you remember from the movie&#8217;s characters? Ptolemy was a boring old man, Olympias a manipulating bitch, Philip had only one eye, Roxane was a hot-blooded exotic beauty with a funny accent and Alexander was a heavy drinker and definitely queer. What images will you carry with you: Egypt looks silly, Babylon looks formidable, war is bloody, elephants are huge and queer men wear mascara.

For all the money it must have cost ([$150 million](http://www.madasafish.com/news/tabloid_bespoke.asp?cat=entertainment&aid=7191817)), it is the by far the worst movie I have seen in the last year, that is, the worst of about sixty movies. It&#8217;s not just boring, it&#8217;s annoying. Chaotic script, bad directing, flat unsympathetic characters, silly special effects, over-the-top acting, tedious melodramatic speeches, way too slow and hence too long.

If you want to see a fun movie, go see &#8220;[Ocean&#8217;s Twelve](http://www.cinebel.be/nl/film.asp?code_film=11350)&#8220;. If you want to see a slow, beautiful, enigmatic movie, go see &#8220;[2046](http://www.cinebel.be/nl/film.asp?code_film=12382)&#8220;. If you want to see a romantic movie with a twist, go see &#8220;[Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind](http://www.cinebel.be/nl/film.asp?code_film=10226)&#8220;. As a last resort, go see &#8220;[National Treasure](http://www.cinebel.be/nl/film.asp?code_film=11771)&#8220;, it&#8217;s an Indiana Jones rip-off, but it&#8217;s bearable. Just don&#8217;t waste time with Alexander.
