I have been messing around with scripts to enable grabbing mixsets automatically, and making a universal [SMIL](http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/)-compatible audio/video player. It looks like I needn&#8217;t bother anymore for the audio part, because [Webjay](http://www.webjay.org) has more or less what I needed for [Smoothouse.org](http://www.smoothouse.org):

  * creation and publishing of playlists (SMIL) 
  * support for Real/WMA/MP3 
  * &#8216;[play-this-page](http://webjay.org/playthispage)&#8216; functionality (grab a page and create a playlist out of all audio links) 
  * publish as RSS or in a Blog (through JavaScript) 
  * [public API](http://webjay.org/api/help), bookmarklets and the lot 
    So I created the [Smoothouse Sept 2004 playlist](http://webjay.org/by/pforret/smooth5c5c5c27ousesep2004) with mixsets that were created last month by various people/sites. Should add up to +- 10 hours of smooth house music, enjoy! </li>
