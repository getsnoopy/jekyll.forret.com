First I thought it was just another spam email, but it wasn&#8217;t. One of my Chinese subscribers sent me an message to warn me that some guy from Antwerp is using my picture on his profile for AsianEuro, a site where Asian and European singles hook up.  
[<img loading="lazy" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/219/506328329_71f510d92c.jpg" width="500" height="468" alt="asianeuro" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/506328329/ "Photo Sharing")  
So this guy describes himself as &#8216;attractive&#8217; but puts a photo of someone else on his profile? If anyone knows this 26y old single psychologist called &#8216;Tom&#8217; who loves football and snowboard, star sign Libra, length 185cm, from Antwerp (how many can there be?) could they give me his coordinates? I&#8217;d like that picture removed before I end up with a Chinese stalker.

Thx Susan!
