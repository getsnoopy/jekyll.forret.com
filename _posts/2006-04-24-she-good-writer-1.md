The first blog is written by [Ingrid Copp&eacute;](http://ingridgoesnewzealand.blogspot.com/), the director of the short film &#8220;[Another Day](http://brussel.blogt.be/2005/10/10/ingrid-coppe-filmfestival-gent.html)&#8220;. She&#8217;s currently working in New-Zealand on some movies. She has a very sharp sense of humour and doesn&#8217;t take herself too seriously. And she&#8217;s Bieke&#8217;s [best friend](http://vanhellemont.blogspot.com/2006/04/we-crazy-as-ever.html).

Here&#8217;s a record of a conversation she had on LAX airport, when picking up a ringing payphone.

> &#8211; Hello?  
> _&#8211; Hi, Is Andrew there?_  
> &#8211; Euh, I don’t think so, I don’t know, there is probably one Andrew here, but I don’t know.  
> _&#8211; Is this 818 564 784 (ok; the number might not be the number he said,.. so sue me, what am I, Rainman???)_  
> &#8211; Euh, I don’t know. You called a payphone in the transit area of LAX. I am waiting for my plane to New Zealand.  
> _&#8211; Oh, New Zealand? I lived in Queenstown for a while. Have you ever been to Queenstown?_  
> &#8211; Yes, a few weeks ago on vacation.  
> _&#8211; Isn’t it the most amazing place? I loved it._  
> &#8211; Yes, it is pretty wild. Quite expensive though, but lovely, I want to go back there.  
> _&#8211; You definitely should, I would love to go back there too._
> 
> ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WE CAN GO BACK TO THE PLANE.  
> Silence.
> 
> &#8211; Listen, they just made an announcement. I have to go.  
> _&#8211; Yeah, I heard._  
> &#8211; I hope you find Andrew.  
> _&#8211; (laughs) Have fun in New Zealand_  
> &#8211; I will, thanks.
> 
> And in a split second I think: Was that the man of my life that I just hung up on?
