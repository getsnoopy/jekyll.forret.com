I will not be posting an update for the 
[Belgian Popular Blogs](http://blog.forret.com/blog/2005/02/popular-belgian-blogs-version-4.htm)
today because I haven&#8217;t had the time yet to add Technorati/PubSub scores. 
Since I expect this will shake up the listing significantly, I want to do it right.

I have had some publicity for the list through [Maarten](http://www.superblog.org/vlaanderen/) 
and [De Standaard](http://standaard.typepad.com/) and of course some bloggers have taken the opportunity 
to take a piss at the initiative. So some clarification: I started the list because of poor 
Astrid Wittebolle&#8217;s article in [De Morgen](http://www.demorgen.be), 
where she had the audacity to [list the Top-5 Belgian bloggers](http://goya.studentenweb.org/archives/archive_2005-m01.php). 
The indignation afterwards _(&#8220;No, **I** was first!&#8221;)_ was amusing, but I realised 
I probably only knew the tip of the iceberg of Belgian bloggers. 
Since there was no adequate top whatever, I started making one myself. 
The project combines some of my pet topics &#8211; social software, search engine metrics, Excel statistics 
&#8211; so it&#8217;s fun to do.

Some blogs are not included because it is impossible to get the right numbers. 
I only include blogs with their own domain name. If someone publishes on _users.skynet.be/jamesdoe/blog/page.html_, 
then I don&#8217;t include that. Maybe in the future I will, but for now, I can&#8217;t get significant statistics.

The results, as I have claimed [from the beginning](/blog/2005/01/popular-belgian-blogs-preliminary-top.html), 
have nothing to do with the &#8216;quality&#8217; of the blog, just the quantitative, measurable criteria 
like link popularity, PageRank, &#8230; My idea of what blogs are worth reading or not, does not enter into the picture. 
For example, I believe the [De Standaard blog](http://standaard.typepad.com/) has great value as a cross-over 
between traditional media and the blogosphere. But it is not featured in the Top #30, 
because its numbers are not high enough (yet?). When I will add blog-specific ratings 
(Technorati, Feedster, PubSub, BlogLines, &#8230;) it might climb up, or not. I have no idea yet.

And to end a little quote (in Dutch, sorry) about the &#8216;VLD-syndrome&#8217; from pietel.be, 
one of the good (my own personal opinion and all that) blogs I discovered by creating this list:

> Dit is een kwaal waarbij je zodanig met jezelf en het kappen op je blog-genoten bezig bent, 
> dat je het eigen publiek totaal uit het oog verliest. 
> Je blogt om gelezen, bekeken of beluisterd te worden en natuurlijk heeft iedereen die hiermee bezig is 
> de pretentie of het ego om te pretenderen dat je iets te vertellen hebt. 
> Anders begin je er niet aan. Ca va de soi, non?
