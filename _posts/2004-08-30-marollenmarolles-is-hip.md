I&#8217;ve been living in the Marolles for 5 years, and it definitely looks like my neighbourhood is getting hip. 

A photo book &#8220;[Marollen/Marolles](http://www.booksinspired.com)&#8221; has been created by Hans Roels and Kurt Deruyter, picturing groups of people from the Marolles: police officers, surgeons, construction workers and of course the Backgammon crowd in La Barri&egrave;re. The book also tells the history of the Marolles. (The book, published by [BooksInspired](http://www.booksinspired.com), is for sale in the FNAC.)

Take a look at their pictures here: [Marollen/Marolles, the pictures](http://www.pixagogo.com/1156595142). 

This Saturday, they even organised a splendid diner for 800 people on the Place Jeu de Balle/Vossenplein. Great food, great weather, great people. Most of the people on the pictures were present, a lot of fellow-marolliens and of course the mayor Thielemans and Prince Laurent.
