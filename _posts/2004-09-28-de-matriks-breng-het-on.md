In our series &#8216;Low Budget DIY movies&#8217;: the Belgian directors/actors C&eacute;dric Rossignol and Sam De Martelaere have made [The Matrix: The Beginning](http://www.forret.com/projects/hizmo/player.asp?url=http%3A%2F%2Fusers.pandora.be%2Frossignol%2Fmatrix_beginning_nosubs.wmv&title=The+Matrix%3A+The+Beginning&width=768&height=432&type=video&format=WM&css=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forret.com%2Fprojects%2Fbmovie%2Fstyle.css): a prequel to the Matrix Trilogy. They wrote the script in2 days, shot the movie in 8 days, probably a couple of days post-production. The result is &#8211; all considered &#8211; amusing.  
Some remarks:  
![don't mess with Ms Payne](http://pix.pixagogo.com/Tools/Thumbnails.aspx?thumb=S5exK9HdVTfRMjZ000kqfPHG47GET6BrzRQfFUqCFYK0kxlxplECuS5XbIpTqD2S8ULkTkrOwLfCnCegw-fVqRHhfKmyl6wcj7) 

  * soundtracks rule. Without music, this would have been amateuristic. With it, &#8230; never mind. 
  * the dialogues are a splendid example of Flenglish, i.e. English with a heavy Flemish accent. (further examples: [beuk.tk](http://users.skynet.be/fa020090/2004/08/tips-voor-de-flenglish-speaker.htm) and [lumberjack.be](http://www.lumberjack.be/weblogs/sare/sare_comments.php?id=296_0_6_0_C)) 
  * the &#8216;bullet time&#8217; scenes are really well done. 
  * the actors/directors/producers are all quite young (the lead actress is 15 yrs old?) 
  * the fight choreographies are funny, certainly when Rossignol, the blond guy, who probably is not much into sports except the ones that involve a force-feedback controller, starts his Neo routine. 
  * there&#8217;s a thin line between slow-motion and just moving slowly.
