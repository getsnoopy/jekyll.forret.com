In our series &#8216;Low Budget DIY movies&#8217;: the Belgian directors/actors C&eacute;dric Rossignol and Sam De Martelaere have made The Matrix: The Beginning: a prequel to the Matrix Trilogy. They wrote the script in2 days, shot the movie in 8 days, probably a couple of days post-production. The result is &#8211; all considered &#8211; amusing.  

Some remarks:
  * soundtracks rule. Without music, this would have been amateuristic. With it, &#8230; never mind. 
  * the dialogues are a splendid example of Flenglish, i.e. English with a heavy Flemish accent. (further examples: [beuk.tk](http://users.skynet.be/fa020090/2004/08/tips-voor-de-flenglish-speaker.htm) and [lumberjack.be](http://www.lumberjack.be/weblogs/sare/sare_comments.php?id=296_0_6_0_C)) 
  * the &#8216;bullet time&#8217; scenes are really well done. 
  * the actors/directors/producers are all quite young (the lead actress is 15 yrs old?) 
  * the fight choreographies are funny, certainly when Rossignol, the blond guy, who probably is not much into sports except the ones that involve a force-feedback controller, starts his Neo routine. 
  * there&#8217;s a thin line between slow-motion and just moving slowly.
