When I [received it for testing](http://blog.forret.com/2006/04/nokia-n91-return-of-the-fin/), it seemed to be all a mobile tech-savvy user could wish for. But time and time again, something happened that pissed me off: battery life, application crashes, losing data, and 2 months ago: refusing to boot. I got fed up with giving it a second chance, and a third &#8230;, and threw it in a drawer. In girl-terms, the phone was a Naomi Campbell: really pretty, but independable on the verge of bipolar. She might work, she might not. Impeccable behaviour or a slap in the face, no way to predict.

Everything about it felt wrong. For some reason, I like the Nokia user interface much better, or even the Samsung one. The V600 buttons felt toy-like, not sturdy. Its USB interface did not have a full or mini USB connector, but something proprietary. In short, it might be an OK phone, but not for me. In girl terms: more like a Britney Spears. Predictably boring and styleless.

<img style="float: right" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/36/77652229_f7c72f0bb2_m.jpg" alt="Paz Vega" /> So I took up the N91 again, went to a Nokia service center (ARC in Zaventem, really nice people) and asked them to help me boot the phone again. When that actually worked, I also installed the [new Nokia firmware](http://www.nokia.com/A4176089?N91) (now 2.10.13) and wow, what a difference. Battery life is now well over 2 days, the phone does not crash anymore and everything works like it is supposed to. I&#8217;ve rediscovered Wifi on a phone, Google over WAP, seamless synchronisation with Outlook, hours of audio/video storage and LifeBlog, which allows me to post pictures directly to Flickr. We&#8217;re in our second honeymoon, sort of. And she&#8217;s turned into a Paz Vega: exciting, no nasty habits and still pretty in the morning.

So before we retreat to the honeymoon suite, just one remark: while it&#8217;s a good idea to let bloggers test your new products, be more clear about what stage the development is in. If I would have been asked to test the phone as a _beta_ model, I would have had different expectations and probably more patience. I sure wouldn&#8217;t have trusted it as sole GSM and burned my fingers when it broke down on me. Anyway: now it&#8217;s out of beta: awesome phone!

I might be totally wrong about their actual personality and I&#8217;ll probably never know. The main reason for the methaphore was to allow me to include pictures of girls, not phones.</small>
