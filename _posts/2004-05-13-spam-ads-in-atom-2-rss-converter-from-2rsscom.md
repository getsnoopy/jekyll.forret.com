I publish my blog via Blogger, and since they refuse to support RSS, I have to find a way to convert my Atom feeds into RSS, so it is accessible for any RSS reader. I had found an on-line service by www.2rss.com that did just that. They only updated once in 4 hours, but that was OK. I was using an older version of SharpReader that did not support Atom feeds, so I was using it for myself too, to read e.g. [Evan Williams&#8217;s blog](http://www.evhead.com/), the guy who created Blogger.

This morning &#8211; to my astonishment &#8211; I saw a bunch of &#8220;ADV: Goto XXX site for YYY&#8221; advert posts coming in. I have some 5 blog feeds that I converted via 2rss.com, and all of them contained 1 or 2 adverts, including mine (that hurt!). OK, 2rss.com may have some bills to pay, but they might have warned me. Anyway, I have to find an alternative now.

  * My aggregator: I want to be able to read Atom feeds without a 3<sup>rd</sup> party converting it. That was easy, I upgraded my [SharpReader to version 0.9.4.1](http://www.sharpreader.net/) and that was done.
  * My own blog feed: how can I automatically convert my Atom feed into an RSS for other people to use? I&#8217;m currently going with [Feedburner.com](http://www.feedburner.com). It adds some nice features while converting to RSS actually, like adding a picture, stats per post, stripping links, &#8230;
