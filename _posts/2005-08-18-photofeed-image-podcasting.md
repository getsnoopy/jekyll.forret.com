As I said in [a previous blog post](http://blog.forret.com/blog/2005/06/rss-with-images-picture-podcasting.html): it&#8217;s not logical that there is no picture podcasting yet, while the content, the devices and the technology are all there. That&#8217;s why I decided to lend the &#8216;loosely coupled&#8217; movement a hand: I just set up a new project:  
[**PHOTOFEED &#8211; IMAGE PODCASTING**](http://photofeed.forret.com).

It introduces the concept of a [Photofeed](http://photofeed.forret.com/photofeed/) (an RSS 2.0 feed with image enclosures &#8211; the picture counterpart of a podcast feed) and also features a service to display photofeeds in any web site: [Photoroll](http://photofeed.forret.com/photoroll/). I invented the term &#8216;photofeed&#8217; (&#8216;photcast&#8217; was an earlier option, but it&#8217;s too limiting)

_(Update: especially for the visitors from [scripting.com](http://www.scripting.com))_  
**What&#8217;s so great about a photofeed?** Well, since there is an image URL specified separately and attached to each feed item, a photofeed consumer application can &#8216;do stuff&#8217; with that image. So you could display the image in whatever layout you want on your site (that&#8217;s my Photoroll), you could have a [photofeed screensaver](http://photofeed.forret.com/blog/2005/08/photofeed-screensaver/), print them, make sepia thumbnails, save them to your iPod photo or PDA, &#8230;

Who already delivers photofeeds? For now, there&#8217;s [Fotothing](http://feeds.fotothing.com/), [Pixagogo](http://www.pixagogo.com/photos/albums/Arts-and-Crafts/Paintings/catid32/photo-album-gallery.html) and [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/), but I hope soon other photo sharing sites will follow. They have one for each of their tags/labels, so you can have an ever changing feed of &#8216;sunset&#8217; images and use it for whatever you want. If you want to make your own photofeed, consider using the [Feedburner](http://www.feedburner.com) [SmartCast for images](http://photofeed.forret.com/photofeed/feedburner.php), which they [kindly developed](http://www.burningdoor.com/feedburner/archives/001299.html) upon my request (doing a &#8216;_Hackathon_&#8216;: great idea!).

What is my purpose with this? Well, I want to introduce the concept so people start playing with it and come up with new and untought-of applications. Do you have the &#8220;_Hey, I could use this to &#8230;_&#8221; feeling? An original hack that does funky stuff with a photofeed? An idea for a way to add &#8216;fitting&#8217; pictures to an existing text-only RSS feed? Geo-photo-feeds? Some social-software remix project? Let me know, leave a comment here or on the [Photofeed Blog](http://photofeed.forret.com/blog/). Just picture it!

Inspiration and support came from people who are maybe not aware of it: [Joris](http://www.jwi.be) from [Pixagogo](http://www.pixagogo.com), [Eric](http://www.burningdoor.com/eric/) from [Feedburner](http://www.feedburner.com), [Alan](http://jade.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/cdb/) from [Feed2JS](http://jade.mcli.dist.maricopa.edu/feed/), [Lucas](http://gonze.com/weblog/) from [Webjay](http://webjay.org) and Erwin from [DopplerRadio](http://www.dopplerradio.net/).
