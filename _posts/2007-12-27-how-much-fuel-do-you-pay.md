My friend Henry asked me to calculate on a napkin how much I spent on fuel per month. I have a greedy car, but I live close to the office. Still I was quite surprised by the number I got.

Let&#8217;s take some examples:

  * You drive a modest [Citroen C3 1.4 HDI](http://web.forret.com/tools/car_cost.asp?l100km=4.4&price=diesel&liter=50&km=200&km_unit=km_7&title=Citroen+C3+1.4HDI) (4.4l/100km). You travel&nbsp;20 km to and from work every day.  
    You pay 5.22€/100km or about 42 €/month.&nbsp;
  * You drive an [Audi A4 break TDI](http://web.forret.com/tools/car_cost.asp?l100km=5.6&price=super95&liter=70&km=800&km_unit=km_7&title=Audi+A4+TDI) (5.6 l/100km). You travel 80 km to and from work every day.  
    You pay 8.23€/100Km, or about 263€/month.
  * You drive a [BMW 750i](http://web.forret.com/tools/car_cost.asp?l100km=11.4&price=super95&liter=88&km=500&km_unit=km_7&title=BMW+750i) (11.4 l/100km). You travel 50km to and from work every day.  
    You pay 16.76€/100km, or about 335€/month.
  * Big spender: you drive a [Range Rover Sport](http://web.forret.com/tools/car_cost.asp?l100km=15.9&price=super95&liter=88&km=1000&km_unit=km_7&title=RangeRover+Sport) (15.90 l/100km). You travel 100km back and forth.  
    You pay 23.37€/100km, or 934 €/month.

OK, if you buy a RangeRover Sport, you&#8217;re not really looking at the price, but still.

How much do you spend?
