My friend [Baare](http://www.baare.com) is participating in a contest for SEO (Search Engine Optimization) specialists. Goal is to get yourself as high as possible in the Google rankings for the search terms **Nigritude Ultramarine**.

By letting the contestants combine content creation (for example, having your fellow geeks write about it in their blogs), creative domain names (check [nigritude-ultramarine.photo-web-site.com/nigritude_ultramarine](http://nigritude-ultramarine.photo-web-site.com/nigritude_ultramarine "Yet another nigritude ultramarine link"), cross-linking, hoaxes, link farms, and more tricks from the book, this will probably prove to be a very useful experiment in Googlistics.

May your nigritude be ultramarine, Baare!
