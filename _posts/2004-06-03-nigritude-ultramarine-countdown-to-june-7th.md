  * Yahoo is catching up on the # of pages indexed. Google has actually dropped! 
  * Most sites were last indexed by Google on June 1st 
  * I saw on the [www.searchtracker.de](http://www.searchtracker.de/db_search.pl?keyword=Nigritude+Ultramarine) site that sim64.co.uk had been #1 from the beginning until its nemesis merkey.net jumped over it around Nov 30 
  * internet-marketing-research.net has disappeared from Top 5. Pity &#8230;
