  <br /> <font color="#000000"><br /> Introspective and reflective, you think about everything and anything.<br /> You are a soft-hearted daydreamer. You long for your ideal life.<br /> You love silence and solitude. Everyday life is usually too chaotic for you.</p> 
  
  <p>
    Given enough time alone, it&#8217;s easy for you to find inner peace.<br /> You tend to be spiritual, having found your own meaning of life.<br /> Wise and patient, you can help people through difficult times.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    At your worst, you brood and sulk. Your negative thoughts can trap you.<br /> You are reserved and withdrawn. This makes it hard to connect to others.<br /> You tend to over think small things, making decisions difficult.<br /> </font></td> </tr> </table>
