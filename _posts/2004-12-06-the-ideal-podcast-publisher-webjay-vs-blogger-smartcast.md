Neither of both was originally made for podcast feeds.  
**Webjay** (put [back online by Lucas after a hacker break-in](http://webjay-in-exile.blogspot.com/)) is actually a great playlist creator tool, whose &#8216;RSS&#8217; converter happens to be podcast compatible.  
**Blogger** is the most used general-purpose blogging tool, and needs to be combined with Feedburner&#8217;s inventive Atom-to-RSS feed converter to allow audio enclosures.

If you compare creating a podcast with both:

Webjay (e.g. [Smoothouse October List](http://webjay.org/by/pforret/smoothouse_oct_2004))
:   **PRO**: zero startup time / also provides M3U, SMIL, ASX playlist support (for playing in WinAmp, RealPlayer, WMP, &#8230;) / has a playlist importer (get all the MP3 links from a page and put them into a playlist
:   **CON**: no way to add meta-data / no way to modify look-and-feel

Blogger + SmartCast (e.g. [Smoothpod Mashups](http://mashup.xampled.com) / [Backroomsounds podcast](http://backroomsounds.blogspot.com))
:   **PRO**: meta-data (playlist/transcription/related links) can be put in the blog post body / optimal results in Google/Technorati/Feedster / maximum flexibility for adapting look &#8216;n feel
:   **CON**: [no that trivial to set up](http://blog.forret.com/2004/10/how-to-podcast-with-blogger-and-smartcast/) / no &#8216;play-it-all-now&#8217; functionality except when added manually

This is what an ideal Podcast publishing tool would look like for me:

  * minimal set-up: no technical knowledge required &#8211; comparable with the setting up of a new Blogger blog
  * adding a new post should be easy &#8211; a wizard like &#8216;add-the-audio-file&#8217; &#8211; &#8216;write-the-text&#8217; &#8211; &#8216;publish!&#8217;.
  * use standard templates like 
    one-person talk show (e.g. [Daily Sourcecode](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001014/categories/dailySourceCode/))
    :   name of the host, list of topics, list of music (if any), some related links
    
    multi-person conversation (e.g. [Gillmor Gang](http://www.itconversations.com/series/gillmorgang.html))
    :   name of participants, list of topics, related links
    
    music show (e.g. [Coverville](http://www.coverville.com/))
    :   host, playlist, guest DJ
    
    &#8230;

  * provide download statistics for the feed and the individual files
  * also provide a &#8216;play-now&#8217; button for each audio file, and maybe a &#8216;play-complete-playlist-now&#8217; functionality
  * be conscious about audio file types (like Webjay): .MP3 can be played by anything, .AAC is for iTunes/iPod, WMA for WMP, &#8230; so you could have a &#8216;subscribe to this podcast with iTunes/RealPlayer/Windows Media Player/&#8230;&#8217; choice
  * automatic ping of audio.weglogs.com (and [Ping-o-Matic](http://pingomatic.com/))
  * take care of directory inclusion ([ipodder OPML](http://www.ipodder.org/directory/4/podcasts), &#8230;)
  * include tools like [BlogTorrent](http://www.blogtorrent.com) or a point-and-click preconfigured FTP uploader for easy audio file upload
  * easy access to directories of RIAA-free music
  * easy access to [feed validator](http://audio.weblogs.com/feedDebug.html)
  * easy access to podcast delivery networks (with cheap bandwidth)
