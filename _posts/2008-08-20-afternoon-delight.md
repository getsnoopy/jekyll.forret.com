For reasons I won&#8217;t disclose, I&#8217;ve had the following song in my head for quite a while now: &#8220;Afternoon Delight&#8221; by Starland Vocal Band (1974). For me the funny thing is the contrast between the innocuous country-music image of the band (withÂ the really pretty Margot Chapman &#8211; born in Hawai) and the lyrics of the song that are a bit, let&#8217;s say, suggestive.

> <!--more-->&#8220;Afternoon Delight&#8221; is a hit song by the Starland Vocal Band, written by Bill Danoff, featuring close harmony and sexually suggestive lyrics. It became a number-one U.S. Billboard Hot 100 single on July 10, 1976.

Some of the lyrics:

> _Thinkin&#8217; of you&#8217;s workin&#8217; up my appetite  
> looking forward to a little afternoon delight.  
> Rubbin&#8217; sticks and stones together makes the sparks ignite  
> and the thought of rubbin&#8217; you is getting so exciting._
> 
> _Sky rockets in flight. Afternoon delight. Afternoon delight._
> 
> _Started out this morning feeling so polite  
> I always though a fish could not be caught who wouldn&#8217;t bite  
> But you&#8217;ve got some bait a waitin&#8217; and I think I might try nibbling  
> a little afternoon delight._

Where the sexual innuendo isn&#8217;t really that hard to discover. According to the author:

<span style="font-size: x-small;"><em>Danoff acknowledged that audiences might find hidden meanings in the song. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to write an all-out sex song, I just wanted to write something that was fun and hinted at sex. It was one of those songs that you could really have a good time writing.&#8221;</em> </span>

There&#8217;s also a cover by Will Ferell /Anchorman:
