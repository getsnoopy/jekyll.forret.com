Remember [Dirty Dancing](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092890/)? I just saw it on TV and I had forgotten how hot [Jennifer Grey](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000426/) looked. That is, if she was 18 when they recorded the movie, otherwise she&#8217;s just pretty.  
They sure played _&#8220;I had the time of my life&#8221;_ a lot for years after that. It even inspired the local girls to shake their hips in a seductive way (occasionally blushing), which is an effect that can only be applauded.  
[Patrick Swayze](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000664/), however, stirrs up mixed emotions. He&#8217;s not a bad dancer, true, but he gives me the creeps. That strange face, the exaggerated muscles, the way he does his &#8216;cool walk&#8217; down the aisle in the final dance scene. And somebody please stop him from singing!

So back to the important stuff. What did Jennifer do after that movie? Mostly TV, it appears. In 2000 she played in &#8220;[Bounce](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0186894/)&#8221; (a Ben Affleck/Gwyneth Paltrow vehicle) but I can&#8217;t recall her appearance there. Judging by the pictures, there&#8217;s a reason. Mrs Grey did not age too well. So I&#8217;ll leave you with the 1987 picture. When she had the time of her life.
