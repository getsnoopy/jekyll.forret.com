At some point he was showing off some steps with a [lovely girl](http://andreaweckerlecopywriting.typepad.com/new_millennium_pr/2006/12/the_five_things.html), I put a [picture of them](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/320351299/) on Flickr and now she tagged me with a meme. Ouch!  
So [Andrea](http://andreaweckerlecopywriting.typepad.com/new_millennium_pr/2006/12/the_five_things.html), (via [Susan](http://getgood.typepad.com/getgood_strategic_marketi/2006/12/five_things_you.html), [Mary](http://www.maryschmidt.com/2006/12/12/five-ten-things-you-dont-know/) and so on), here I go: _Five things you probably don&#8217;t know about me_.

  1. When I was a toddler, I was blond; I had long curly almost white hair. I must have turned to auburn around the age of 10.
  2. I am often diagnosed with a light form of ADHD by people familiar with other &#8216;cases&#8217;. I have these hyperactive moments, even spurts of hyper-concentration, and I must say I enjoy them. I get loads of stuff done while I should be doing other stuff, i.e. I practise [structured procrastination](http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/). In my line of work, I think the advantages and the drawbacks of this personality trait even out. On the other hand, you wouldn&#8217;t want me as your accountant.

  3. For some reason house music has the same effect on me as coffee, and I need a dose of both to get my day started. I like my coffee the Italian way, small and strong, and my house music the soulful way: deep, vocal or slightly discofied. Invariably, the kick on the 1 and 3, the claps on the 2 and 4 and hihats in beween make me feel better and put a smile on my face. One day I&#8217;m going to the [Southport Weekender festival](http://www.southportweekender.co.uk/) for a total house immersion therapy. Personal favourites: [Frankie Knuckles](http://www.deephousepage.com/search_results.php?nRecSet=0&searchString=frankie%20knuckles), [Mateo and Matos](http://mateomatos.blogspot.com/2006/06/june-mix-part-2.html), [Masters at Work](http://backroomsounds.blogspot.com/2006/05/andy-ward-classic-cuts.html), [Traxsource](http://www.smoothouse.com/deephouse/2006/10/traxsource-show-101.html) &#8230; To see that my daughter is picking up on some of that, and that she really likes music like Jill Scott, Jamiroquai, Stevie Wonder and Amerie is a source of pride!
  4. While I have no problems being alone, I sometimes need to see and talk to lots of people in a short time. That&#8217;s one of the reasons why I organized [Barcamp Brussels](http://barcamp.forret.com/) and the [Bloggers meeting](http://blog.forret.com/2005/09/brussels-bloggers-meeting-on-oct-7/), and why I volunteer for events like the [Bronks](http://www.bronks.be/) theatre festival and the [Marollen diner](http://blog.forret.com/2004/08/marollenmarolles-is-hip/). If you ever wanna see me hyperactive, catch me on one of those events. It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m on drugs, but in a good way (I think).
  5. [<img loading="lazy" src="http://static.flickr.com/133/324341651_706611b8f7_m.jpg" style="float: right" width="240" height="180" alt="Formentera: make your own guitar" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pforret/324341651/)A dream holiday I would want to have is the following: go to [Formentera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formentera) for 3 weeks and [build my own bass guitar](http://www.formentera-guitars.com/).  
    Why Formentera? Because it was the idyllic location for one of my favourite movies, [Lucia y el sexo](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0254455/) (Julio Medem). It&#8217;s like the silent niece of Ibiza.  
    Why build a bass guitar? Because it&#8217;s just th&eacute; coolest instrument that exists and actually making one out of a large piece of wood must be so rewarding.

So who will I pass this &#8216;Five Things&#8217; meme to? Why, the LeWeb3 buddies, of course:
