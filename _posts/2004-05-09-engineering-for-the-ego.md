I impressed my daughter today! The CD-ROM drive in her computer was stuck halfway and wouldn&#8217;t move anymore.

I opened up the case, took out the drive, removed the casing and peeked into the interior with a completely fake &#8216;I know what I&#8217;m doing&#8217; look on my face. I saw a piece of plastic that was twisted, I removed it (silently praying), I put everything back together (actually I did that twice, I forgot some parts the first time) and voila: it worked! Elementary, my dear Watson. And I probably made the same impression on Clemence as my father used to make on me: my dad can fix anything!

Actually, for some reason this technique works quite often: you reverse-engineer a gizmo, optionally you actually fix something, you put everything back together and it works. The trick is then to put an expensive label on it: &#8220;Presumably a bad contact&#8221;, &#8220;Undoubtedly a rogue device driver&#8221;. In this case: an acute mechanical encumbrance.
