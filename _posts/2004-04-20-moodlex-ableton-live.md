I saw a gig some weeks ago by Moodlex: just one guy with a portable PC, mixing his music live.  
It was awesome, terribly funky. I just had to know what he was using for software, that made it so easy and intuitive to do live mixing/composing.  
I think there &#8216;s a fair chance he was using [Ableton Live](http://www.ableton.com/). I&#8217;ve downloaded the trial version and hope to test it out soon on my new DAW system.

Oh yeah, I also saw Briskey there, a group similar to Sven van Hees, but not that good. Only, their female jazz drummer, Isolde Lasoen, she&#8217;s great &#8211; in more than one aspect. I hope to see her again with the band Skeemz on the [Brussels Jazz Marathon](http://www.brusselsjazzmarathon.be). She&#8217;s the girl on the sofa in the back on their first video, but you have to see her drumming to fully appreciate.
