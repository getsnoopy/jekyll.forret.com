I finally got too fed up working with [a crippled PC](http://blog.forret.com/2006/06/murphy-forret-1-0/) and installed the Windows Vista Beta 2 on my laptop. It looks really nice, although slightly slow. I connected my camera and, lo and behold, the Picture import works flawlessly, creating a separate folder per session, the Vista Photo browser and editor remind me a lot of Google&#8217;s Picasa. Internet Explorer 7 has tabbed browsing at last, and seemed quite stable and robust. In all, I was quite happy to have a working system again.

But then I connected my iPod nano. The drivers loaded automatically so that felt normal. But ever since, my IE hasn&#8217;t worked anymore. It starts up, takes 100% CPU and does nothing useful. Every time I connect my camera, the Windows Explorer crashes. I can manually start up the Picture importer, sure, but for a system with almost no applications installed, that feels wrong. I get warnings saying applications and/or drivers crash, and that might be fixed in the next &#8216;Customer Release&#8217;.

My patience with poorly working computers being at an all-time low, I just popped in the Acer recovery system, and am installing Windows XP again. I&#8217;ll gladly try Vista once it&#8217;s out of beta, and when I have a more powerful system. For now, I need a dependable laptop.
