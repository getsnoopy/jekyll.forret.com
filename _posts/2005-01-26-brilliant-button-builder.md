I needed some buttons to accompany my [Webjay Wizard](http://www.smoothouse.org/smoothouse/webjay.asp). I like the 80&#215;15 format used by most sites, and was looking for an on-line button maker application.

The one most sites point to is the [Kalsey.com buttonmaker](http://kalsey.com/tools/buttonmaker/), but it does not support the usage of image files. You still can make nice buttons like:

It took me a while longer to find [Luca Zappa&#8217;s Brilliant Button Maker](http://www.lucazappa.com/brilliantMaker/buttonImage.php). It allows the usage of jpg/gif/png files to include in the button. With this one, I could re-use [Webjay](http://www.webjay.org)&#8216;s logo to create:

And a vanity button with my Ibanez EDC-705:
