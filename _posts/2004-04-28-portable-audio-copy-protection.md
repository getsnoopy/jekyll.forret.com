Dear Record Company,

I just received my latest shipment from [Amazon.co.uk](http://www.amazon.co.uk "Amazon.co.uk"). Previewing songs, referral to related artists, only 2 days between ordering and delivery, I love shopping the Amazon way. Which is probably why I buy around 50 CDs a year.

Amongst the CDs I ordered([BuzzinFly](http://www.buzzinfly.com/buzzed.html), [Kinobe](http://www.kinobe.co.uk/), Deep Dish) was the new [Zero 7](http://www.zero7.co.uk) CD: _&#8220;When it falls&#8221;_. I saw the group live in Brussels, they were great!

Now the issue is the following: their CD has an invention from hell called &#8220;copy-protection&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know what you use, Macrovision or something, but it stinks!  
The backcover mentions _&#8220;can also be played on most CD-ROM drives, by means of the included compressed file&#8221;_. So I tried it on my PC.

Result: my Windows Media Player keeps crashing on it &#8211; mostly taking my PC with it, because the CD-ROM becomes inaccesible. My MusicMatch won&#8217;t play it, and I haven&#8217;t even tried RealPlayer, because I don&#8217;t want to reboot more than 3 times in a day, life&#8217;s too short. So I can only look at the cover and wonder what it sounds like. Oh, it will probably play in my DVD player back home (it&#8217;s an old Sony, it doesn&#8217;t support MP3). But not here, now, in the 4 devices I have at my disposal that I use for &#8216;normal&#8217; CDs.

Not only do you &#8216;make it hard&#8217; to copy the CD, you also &#8216;make it hard&#8217; to listen to it. All that to prevent me from copying my CD. Why in heaven&#8217;s name would I want to copy/rip the CD?

  * Recently my car got vandalized, all my CDs were gone. Luckily they were copies. I keep the originals back home. 
  * There is no CD insurance that gives me a new CD when the old one is scratched. 
  * I make MP3 compilations for listening in my car. 10 CDs give me 60 albums. 
  * My Nokia 5510 does not accept CDs 

But I know, you guys are very anal about your content. And every young kid is copying and exchanging hundreds of albums<sup>1</sup>, right?

I can only say, you&#8217;re now using a flaky &#8216;copy protection&#8217; system that prohibits me from listening to a CD I just purchased. It will not play on over 80% of the audio equipment I&#8217;ve got.  
What&#8217;s next, CDs only playable on your own &#8216;certified&#8217; CD players?

> **My request to record companies:**  
> Inform the on-line record stores on what CDs are using &#8216;copy procection&#8217;.  
> Make sure I can see on Amazon if you&#8217;ve messed with a CD I want to buy.  
> Just like DVD zones 1, 2 and 3: I don&#8217;t want to buy Zone 1 DVDs, because I can&#8217;t play &#8217;em.  
> **_I don&#8217;t want to buy &#8216;Copy protected&#8217; CDs, because I can&#8217;t play &#8217;em!_** 

Oh wait, here&#8217;s a thought: offer your music on [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/), tell &#8217;em to speed up their Europe operation and I&#8217;ll happily download it at 1$/song and enjoy it whenever and wherever I choose. Stop swimming against the stream, use it.

<sup>1</sup>Just out of curiosity: did the average kid buy 100 albums/year 20 years ago? Are you sure it&#8217;s all &#8216;missed business&#8217;? I know I couldn&#8217;t afford that.
