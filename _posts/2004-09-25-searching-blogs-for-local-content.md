The Belgian weekly newsletter [T-Zine](http://www.tijd.be/ondernemen/t-zine/) has just published an article about the site of the [Belgian National Institute of Statistics (N.I.S./I.N.S.)](http://www.statbel.fgov.be/). This government agency publishes census data on population, employment, investments, &#8230;  
Quickly browsing through some numbers shows e.g. that Belgium has [the lowest % of people working between 50 and 64 years old](http://statbel.fgov.be/figures/d31_nl.asp#2) in the European Union (we&#8217;re at 40%, Sweden is at 72%), which might indicate that we allow &#8216;pre-pension&#8217; (retiring at 50 or 55) too easily.

The site also have a very complete list of links to [the world&#8217;s country statistics](http://statbel.fgov.be/port/cou_en.asp), so if you want to know

  * how many inhabitants Belarus had in 2002 (9.940.000 &#8211; it&#8217;s way bigger than Ireland and I didn&#8217;t even have a clue where it was!)
  * how popular mobile phones are in Malta ( 290.000 phones on a population of 395.000: 73% penetration rate &#8211; Belgium is at 83%)
  * who the European Internet early and late adopters are (in 2001, Iceland had 69% of its citizens that were Internet users, Greece 13%)

it&#8217;s a great place to start. They even have a [RSS newsfeed](http://statbel.fgov.be/info/news_nl.asp), I kid you not. Do not make fun of Belgian e-government.

On a related topic, I was trying to find out if this mentioning of the site in T-Zine had led to Belgian Blog activity.  
Searching on Technorati and Feedster on &#8216;**statbel**&#8216; gave me nothing, so I started looking to other blog search engines.  
The results:

Basically the answer was: no recent related blog activity, but certainly the statbel.fgov.be site has been referenced in the past so Technorati and Bloglines seem to be the better sources for searching.

Next question I asked myself was: let&#8217;s say I wanted to limit this search to only Belgian blogs. How hard would that be?  
[<img style="float: right" border="0" width="300" src="http://www.pixagogo.com/Tools/Thumbnails.aspx?thumb=S5!pg7swZZxdFnZUAVRJNcnMae612BzqmjKNivBNOB-IZTX2E8IAZM8zzUFx-n3RAvdrId-03AggbqQV0cOeMOvixg1PR4mhhMNAopsQmt1XU_" />](http://lvb.net/item/467 "Belgian Bloggers @ lvb.net")

  * In Google one could use &#8220;_site:.be_&#8220;, but 1) Google is not ideal for blog-only search, and 2) not all Belgian bloggers have a .be domain (blogspot.com users, for one) 
  * Luk Van Braekel has a [map of Belgian Bloggers @ lvb.net](http://lvb.net/item/467), but that list of Belgian blogs is not public and is not complete (currently 85 blogs &#8211; Luk, you can probably guess how I know ;-). 
  * Blogwise has a [list of Belgian blogs](http://www.blogwise.com/bycountry.php?country=26), but you can&#8217;t search them and the list is not complete (currently 218 entries &#8211; [LVBlog](http://lvb.net/item/467) is not there) 
  * one can search on Dutch words like _&#8216;statistieken&#8217;_ in order to limit the results to dutch-written blogs, but this might also include .nl blogs (God forbid) and excludes Belgian dudes that write in English (pompous bastards). 
  * none of the blog search engines supports geograpical searching 

Makes one wonder, is there an opportunity for localised (European) blog search?

_PS: I&#8217;ve added all the above mentioned blog search engines to my [StereoSearch](http://www.forret.com/projects/hizmo/stereosearch.asp?left=bloglines&q=forret&right=feedster) page._
