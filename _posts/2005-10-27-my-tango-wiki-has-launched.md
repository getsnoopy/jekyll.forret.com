I have had a tango site for almost two years now. You know how it goes, you start with collecting some tango-related links (hey, look, a description of the _giro_!) and before you know it, you have developed your own poor-man&#8217;s-wiki-like tango glossary. Hard to extend, hard to update.

So I thought, let&#8217;s bite the bullet and install a real wiki ([MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki)), and drop all my tango information in there. I installed it 3 months ago, spent a lot of time copy/pasting the info while annotating it and here it is:  
<big><a href="http://tango.smoothouse.com">tango.smoothouse.com &#8211; the Tango wiki</a></big>  
featuring info on tango music, tango movies but first and foremost: the [Tango Glossary](http://tango.smoothouse.com/wiki/index.php?title=Tango_Glossary) &#8211; an extensive list of tango words, steps and figures.

**Why a wiki?**  
The type of information I want to collect on this tango site is ideal for a wikipedia-like set-up. When you explain what the [Cruzada](http://tango.smoothouse.com/wiki/index.php?title=Cruzada) position is, you need to talk about the [Paso basico](http://tango.smoothouse.com/wiki/index.php?title=Paso_basico) (8-count basic step), so you would link to to it. And from there you would want to link to the [Salida](http://tango.smoothouse.com/wiki/index.php?title=Salida), the [Resolucion](http://tango.smoothouse.com/wiki/index.php?title=Resolucion), &#8230; So you have a lot of interconnected words and concepts that all link to on another. There is no concept of a publication date (which is so typical for blogs). There is no concept of a question/answer (like forums). So obviously a wiki is the way to go.  
The main advantage for me is the ability to edit on-line in a web-interface and easy interlinking ([[KEYWORD]] creates a link to the explanation of KEYWORD). Even better, I am not the only one who can edit the data, anyone can add to the site. I am of course worried by possible abuse (e.g. the standard &#8220;Help:Contents&#8221; page has already been attacked by several bots who fill it with links to dubious sites), but for now I will go with the community spirit, fingers crossed.

So anyone with some experience in tango: you too can participate in the adding/updating of my [Tango Wiki](http://tango.smoothouse.com)! Just click &#8220;Edit&#8221; on any page and start writing!
